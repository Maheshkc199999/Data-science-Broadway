Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) has decided not to support the current ruling coalition that includes CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center).
RPP Spokesperson Mohan Shrestha told Setopati that a meeting of the party’s office-bearers held at Dhumbarahi of Kathmandu on Wednesday concluded that the party cannot support the coalition that has formed the present federal government.
“The party office-bearers’ meeting has decided not to support the ruling coalition that has formed the federal government,” Shrestha said.
RPP, however, has hinted at the possibility of supporting provincial governments headed by Nepali Congress.
“We won’t support the UML-Maoist coalition in the provinces,” Shrestha said. “We will support Congress-led governments if necessary, but RPP won’t join the government.”
RPP had been saying earlier that it was not involved in power-centric politics.
With RPP deciding against supporting the UML-Maoist coalition, forming a government in Gandaki province appears difficult for the coalition.
Gandaki Chief Minister Surendra Raj Pandey resigned from the post earlier on Wednesday. The province chief has given one week to stake claim for the post of chief minister.
The UML-Maoist coalition cannot form a government in Gandaki without RPP as they need the support of 31 lawmakers to secure a majority.
NC is the largest party in Gandaki with 27 seats. UML has 22 seats, Maoist Center 8, RPP two and CPN (Unified Socialist) one.

The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) has filed a case against 32 individuals including former minister Jeevan Bahadur Shahi charging them with corruption in the procurement of two widebody aircraft.
The CIAA filed the case at the Special Court on Thursday seeking Rs 1.47 billion ($13.39 million) in claims from the accused, according to the court’s assistant spokesperson Yagya Raj Regmi.
Along with former minister Shahi, the anti-graft body has also named former general manager of Nepal Airlines Corporation (NAC) Sugat Ratna Kansakar, the then director general of Department of Customs Shishir Dhungana, Joint Secretary and the then NAC board member Buddhi Sagar Lamichhane, Tourism Secretary and the then NAC board chairman Shankar Prasad Adhikari, the then general manager of Department of Money Laundering Investigation and NAC board member Jeevan Prakash Sitaula, the then acting director of NAC Ramhari Sharma Sedhain, the then acting director and present deputy general manager Janak Raj Kalakheti, and the then NAC deputy director Prabhas Kumar Karmacharya as defendants in the case.
Similary, the CIAA has charged the aircraft suppliers with corruption. They include British national Deepak Sharma, president of International Supply Chain, AAR Corp Inc, USA; German national Christian Nuehlen, director of Hifly X Ireland Limited and representative of German Aviation Capital Germany; Oleg Calistru, finance director of German Aviation Capital Germany; John M Holmes, president and CEO of AAR International Inc USA; Ana Topa, managing director of German Aviation Capital GMBH Germany; Paulo Mirpuri, president of Hifly Airlines Portugal; Gerald Thornton, director of Hifly X Ireland Limited; Markus Radbruch, head of aviation at Norton Rose Fulbright LLP Germany, and Ralf Springer, senior consultant at Norton Rose Fulbright.
The NAC formed a sub-committee under Kansakar on January 18, 2016, for procurement of new planes. The government on September 14, 2016 wrote to the NAC stating it would provide guarantee for procurement of airplanes.
The NAC on September 26 in the same year published a 45-day notice for procurement of two Airbus planes. The notice had invited bids for Airbus A 330-200 planes with Rolls-Royce Trent 772B engines that have clocked 1,000 flights hours.
The sub-committee formed by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament concluded in its report that inviting bids for old planes and specifying the kind of engines violated the Public Procurement Act that prohibits mention of a particular brand, trademark, patent, design or manufacturer while preparing specifications except when there is no other option. It also took exception to procurement of the planes from an agent instead of procuring it directly from the manufacturer.
The NAC acquired the first wide-body plane on June 28 and the second on July 26, 2017. The procurement process came under the scanner after it was revealed that the NAC ahd procured planes with maximum takeoff weight of 230 tons after formulating a business plan to procure those with 242 tons.
The PAC had concluded after investigation in 2018 that the NAC had suffered a loss of Rs 4.35 billion in the procurement.

Nepali Congress (NC) is set to field Dambar Bahadur Khadka in Ilam-2 House of Representatives constituency and Abhishek Singh in Bajhang-1(A) of the provincial assembly of Far West in the upcoming by-election.
The grand old party looks set to field Khadka and Sigh, who are both from the faction of NC President Sher Bahadur Deuba, with Deuba refusing to field others even after four days of discussion in the party.
Deuba and other NC office-bearers held discussion with those recommended for candidacy in Ilam-2 at the Deuba residence in Budhanilkantha Thursday morning.
All the aspirants claimed that they will win the election but added that the party should send a message that NC is united by picking the candidate unanimously.
“It is almost confirmed that Khadka will get the ticket for Ilam and Singh for Bajhang as President Deuba did not budge from his stance,” an office-bearer confided with Setopati. “Working committee meeting will be held at Budhanilkantha later on Thursday. That will take the formal decision.”  
Leader Shekhar Koirala, who had lost the run-off for NC president to Deuba in the last general convention, and General Secretary Gagan Thapa have demanded that Behsh Raj Acharya, who was ranked top while being recommended by the local party committee, be fielded in Ilam-2 and Jagat Joshi in Bajhang but to no avail.
The Ilam-2 constituency has been vacant after the death of CPN-UML Vice-chairman Subash Nembang on September 12, 2023 and Bajhang-1(A) after the death of Prithvi Bahadur Singh who was elected on an NC ticket.
Khadka had lost to Nembang by a very slender margin in Ilam-2 and Singh is son of Prithvi Bahadur Singh.

The election for National Assembly vice-chair has been scheduled for April 10.
National Assembly Chairman Narayan Dahal said that the election for the post of National Assembly vice-chair will be held on April 10.
Dahal informed the National Assembly meeting held on Wednesday that the election was set according to Rule 8 of the National Assembly Regulations 2018.
He has also instructed Federal Parliament General Secretary Padma Prasad Pandeya to publish a notice regarding the election.

Chief Minister (CM) of Gandaki province Surendra Raj Pandey has resigned from his post.
CM Pandey submitted his resignation to Gandaki Province Chief Dilli Raj Bhatta on Wednesday.
The chief minister’s press coordinator Narahari Sapkota told Setopati that CM Pandey resigned on Wednesday morning.
He had called a meeting of the council of ministers before resigning.
The Pandey-led government had fallen into minority after CPN (Maoist Center) withdrew its support to the government.
Thirty-one lawmakers are required to secure a majority in Gandaki. CM Pandey was required to take a vote of confidence by Thursday. But he resigned from the post after it appeared unlikely for him to secure a majority.
CM Pandey is the parliamentary party leader of Nepali Congress in Gandaki. NC is the largest party in Gandaki with 27 lawmakers.
CPN-UML has 22 seats, Maoist Center has eight including the speaker, Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) two and CPN (Unified Socialist) one.
NC is of the view that the coalition of UML and Maoist Center won’t be able to secure a majority for government formation as RPP has said that it is not involved in power-centric politics at present.
Pandey is preparing to again stake claim for the post of chief minister as the leader of the largest party if the new coalition fails to form a government.
Pandey was appointed CM according to Article 168 (2) of the Constitution on April 27 last year. Lawmakers from NC, Maoist Center and independent lawmaker Rajeev Gurung had supported him then.

The ruling coalition has decided to give chief minister (CM) of Far West to CPN (Unified Socialist).
Unified Socialist Chairman Madhav Kumar Nepal demanded CM of at least one province during the meeting of top leaders of the five parties in the ruling coalition on Sunday.
The meeting of CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli and Nepal held in Baluwatar on Monday has decided to give CM of Far West to the party formed after splitting from UML, according to a Baluwatar source.
They also agreed for different coalition parties taking turns as Bagmati CM.
Bagmati CM Shalik Ram Jammakattel, who has called floor test for Monday, is likely to pass the floor test after the latest deal. Unified Socialist parliamentary party leader Krishna Khanal will succeed Jammakattel as Bagmati CM as per the deal, according to a Unified Socialist source.
Unified Socialist has four provincial lawmakers in Koshi, seven in Bagmati, one (Deepak Manange) in Gandaki, one each in Karnali and Lumbini, and four in Far West.
Oli and Dahal had earlier finalized sharing of provincial governments with UML getting to lead in Koshi, Gandaki and Karnali, Maoist Center in Bagmati and Lumbini, and Janamat in Madhes.
They had agreed to give CM of Far West to Nagarik Unmukti Party if the party were to agree. But Nepal’s demand on Sunday has forced Dahal and Oli to change tack.
The meeting between Maoist Chairman and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) President Rabi Lamichhane and Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) Chairman Upendra Yadav held at Baluwatar on March 3 agreed to form a new ruling coalition. CPN (Unified Socialist) has also joined the coalition since then.
The previous coalition was formed around a year ago before the election for president after Dahal broke the then coalition with UML. NC, Maoist Center, JSP and Unified Socialist had then decided to revive the pre-election alliance.
Dahal had quit the pre-election alliance with NC and Unified Socialist on December 25, 2022 and became prime minister (PM) with support of CPN-UML, Rastriya Swatantra Party, RPP, Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP), Janamat Party and Nagarik Unmukti Party after Nepali Congress (NC) President Sher Bahadur Deuba refused to make him PM first.
Oli had assured NC that UML will not ally with Maoist Center at any cost and would instead ally with NC to form the new government to encourage Deuba to break the agreement to make Dahal PM first.
Dahal was constitutionally required to seek floor test again after the largest party in the House, NC, decided to withdraw support from the government.

The meeting ended inconclusively after CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli did not agree with that demand.
Nepal has also demanded that parties in the ruling coalition should get to equally share the spoils in appointments at the constitutional bodies. “We will not have any role in forming and saving the provincial governments in the current situation otherwise,” a leader who attended the meeting quoted Nepal as warning.
Bagmati CM Shalik Ram Jammakattel, who has called floor test for Monday, seems to be the first one to be affected by the stand of Unified Socialist formed after splitting from UML.
Unified Socialist parliamentary party leader in Bagmati Krishna Khanal has told Setopati that the current coalition has been formed merely for power and not for any ideology, and added that the party should also get a share in the spoils.
Unified Socialist has four provincial lawmakers in Koshi, seven in Bagmati, one (Deepak Manange) in Gandaki, one each in Karnali and Lumbini, and four in Far West.

Speaker Devraj Ghimire has ruled the letter written by Janamat Party to remove Goma Labh Sapkota as a member of the House of Representatives (HoR) as wrong.
Janamat had written to the Federal Parliament Secretariat on March 10 stating that it had sought clarification from lawmaker Sapkota and expelled her from the party as punishment.
Speaker Ghimire has refused to remove Sapkota saying that she does not seem to have quit the party and does not seem to have been expelled from the party.
The Federal Parliament Secretariat in its letter sent to Janamat Party has said that the action against Sapkota seems to be erroneous prima facie on the basis of law and procedures mentioned in section 32 of the Political Parties Act, and the action taken against her cannot be moved forward ignoring the erroneous act.
Lawmaker Sapkota had requested Speaker Ghimire to save her post saying even the clarification said to be hers was fake after the party sent the letter seeking her removal.
Janamat had made Sapkota, a resident of Mahottari Rural Municipality-3, Mahottari, lawmaker under the proportional representation electoral system.
Lawmaker Sapkota, meanwhile, said that she had differences with the party over appointment of personal secretary and that the party punished her for the same reason.
She said that Janamat Chairman CK Raut had told her since the beginning that she could not appoint a personal secretary on her own and that she should appoint someone recommended by the party. Following a dispute over the issue, she was threatened with action and removal from the post of lawmaker, Sapkota added.
Sapkota said that she had initially appointed Samir Kumar Jha from the party as her personal secretary and later replaced him with Ashok Sah on the party’s recommendation. She then made Mansi Jha her personal secretary as Sah never contacted her, Sapkota added.

A joint bench of Justices Manoj Kumar Sharma and Binod Sharma hearing the petition filed by Gurung, who was elected to the House of Representatives (HoR) from Manang, has issued the writ as demanded by the petitioner.
The Federal Parliament Secretariat issuing a notice on December 27, 2022, had stated that Gurung was suspended as the corruption case lodged against him by the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) was sub judice at the Special Court.
The Secretariat had said that he was suspended as per the legal provision of automatic suspension until acquittal from the corruption case.
The Special Court had found nine persons including Gurung guilty in the corruption case on February 28, 2023, but did not jail him and just fined him. The provisions for ineligibility of lawmaker require the person to be jailed and not just ruled guilty in criminal cases including corruption.
Gurung had then lodged the writ petition at the SC on March 5, 2023, demanding revocation of the suspension arguing that he was not jailed in the case and pointing at other discrepancies in the process of suspension. The SC has issued the writ demanded by Gurung on Friday.
Gurung was found guilty of corruption by charging a lower rate of rent while he was director of the Fun Park at Bhrikuti Mandap.

The Chitwan District Court has remanded CPN (Maoist Center) leader Kali Bahadur Kham to judicial custody in the case related to the murder of businessman Ram Hari Shrestha.
A bench of Judge Dayaram Dhakal on Friday ordered that Kham be sent to judicial custody.
Shrestha was murdered at the then Maoist People’s Liberation Army (PLA)’s third division cantonment in Jutepani, Chitwan, on May 10, 2008. His wife Ramila Shrestha filed a complaint with the police claiming that the murder was carried out on the instruction of Kham, who was then the division commander of the third division cantonment.
The cantonment’s brigade commander Govinda Batala was arrested in connection with the murder but Kham had been absconding. Kham was arrested on Monday and brought to Chitwan. Two other accused, Keshav Adhikari and Ganga Ram Thapa, are still at large.
In 2008, a theft took place at the PLA third division’s liaison office at Shrestha’s house in Koteshwar of Kathmandu. The third division office assigned brigade commander Batala the task of investigating the theft of Rs 1.7 million and pistols from the office.
On April 27, 2008, Batala abducted Shrestha and brought him to Chitwan from Kathmandu on Kham’s instruction to make him confess the theft. Shrestha was murdered 13 days later. His body was thrown into the Trishuli River and later found in the Narayani River.
Batala informed the third division office about Shrestha’s murder only three days after the incident. The office informed the police about it on May 15, 2008. The police then took the case to court.
The Supreme Court has already acquitted Batala in the case overturning the verdicts of the district and appellate courts.
The Chitwan District Court and the Hetauda Appellate Court had sentenced him to prison for three years stating that he was an accomplice in the murder. He was in jail for three years until the district court gave its verdict.
Police are preparing to take Kham to the Chitwan District Prison.

The Supreme Court has remanded suspended district judge Bhuwan Giri to custody in a marital rape case.
A joint bench of Justices Hari Prasad Phuyal and Til Prasad Shrestha on Wednesday issued an order to remand Giri to custody.
The district court had released Giri on bail and the high court had upheld the lower court’s decision.
The apex court revoked the high court’s decision deeming it unreasonable.
The victim had filed a complaint against Giri accusing him of marital rape. She had later lodged another complaint accusing Giri of coming to her room in Kathmandu and raping her while that case and a divorce case were sub judice in court.
During the course of investigation into the complaint, the landlord and two other women had testified that they had heard Giri had raped the woman.
The bench of Phuyal and Shrestha has said that it was unusual that Giri went to the victim’s room alone under such circumstances.
In view of all the circumstances and evidence, it cannot be said at present that Giri is not guilty, the SC has said in its order.
Giri’s wife had filed a marital rape complaint against him when he was the district judge in Kapilvastu. The Judicial Council had suspended him after a case was filed against him in court following an investigation into the complaint.

CPN (Maoist Center) Vice-chairman Krishna Bahadur Mahara has been remanded to custody for four days.
A bench of Kathmandu District Court Judge Durga Prasad Khanal on Monday granted the police permission to keep Mahara in custody for four days, according to the court’s information officer Chandra Prasad Panthi.
Police had arrested Mahara from Kapilvastu on Monday morning over his alleged involvement in the smuggling of nine kilograms of gold disguised as e-cigarettes in December 2022. He was flown to Kathmandu later in the day.
The Central Investigation Bureau (CIB) of Nepal Police has begun investigation against Mahara on the charge of organized crime.
The CIB had earlier released Mahara after making him sign necessary documents in the 9 kg gold smuggling case.
In its investigation report on the 9 kg gold smuggling case submitted to the District Government Attorney’s Office, Kathmandu, the CIB had included a link chart which also showed that Mahara was in contact with Daojin Wang, the alleged mastermind behind the gold smuggling.
The Inquiry Commission on Gold Smuggling, in its report submitted to Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane on Thursday, concluded that Mahara should also be tried for gold smuggling.
The CIB has received the commission’s report from the Nepal Police Headquarters.
Additional Inspector General (AIG) Shyam Gyawali is the current chief of CIB. He replaced AIG Kiran Bajracharya as CIB chief after the inquiry commission recommended departmental action against Bajracharya citing lapses in the investigation.
Mahara and his son Rahul came under investigation after police found that they were in contact with those involved in bringing nine kilograms of gold disguised as e-cigarettes in December 2022.
In its investigation report on the 9 kg gold smuggling case submitted to the District Government Attorney’s Office, Kathmandu, the CIB of Nepal Police had included a link chart which also showed that Mahara was in contact with Daojin Wang, the alleged mastermind behind the gold smuggling.
The customs office at the Tribhuvan International Airport had confiscated 730 e-cigarettes from a Chinese national named Li Hansong who arrived on a Fly Dubai flight on December 25, 2022.
When Li claimed that the e-cigarettes were brought for business purpose, Chief Customs Officer Mukti Prasad Shrestha had ordered confiscation of the e-cigarettes giving one to the Chinese national for the latter’s use pointing that goods brought for commercial purpose cannot be cleared from the passengers’ section.
The Chinese national, who was allowed to leave after confiscation of the e-cigarettes, left Nepal after staying here for a few days.
The Mahara father-son duo then contacted the chief customs officer and put pressure on him to release the e-cigarettes.
The authorities found out that the e-cigarettes were actually gold only after investigations when a staffer at the customs office realized that the e-cigarettes had been changed from the store.
A non-gazetted first-class official of TIA Customs Office Rewant Khadka and customs agent Dinesh Basnet had collaborated to change the e-cigarettes, extracted around nine kilograms of gold from the e-cigarettes and sold it for Rs 60 million by then.
The CIB then investigated and filed a case against five people after the incident came to light.
Rahul is also in custody over his alleged involvement in the smuggling.

The statement cited organizer Wayne Price as saying the assailant was “known to the police for orchestrating similar incidents in the past” and that Schwarzenegger was “fine and still in good spirits.” The actor confirmed he had no intention of pursuing charges and would continue with another appearance on Sunday as planned, the statement said.

Mother’s Day is in a couple weeks, but Drake gave his mom an early gift with a heartfelt speech at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards, where the rap star also broke Taylor Swift’s record for most wins. Drake turned up the love for his mom when he picked up top artist, besting Cardi B, Ariana Grande, Post Malone and Travis Scott. He won 12 awards Wednesday in Las Vegas, making his career total 27 (Swift has 23 wins). He looked up to the ceiling as he held the trophy, then said: “I just want to thank my mom for her relentless effort in my life. “I want to thank my mom for all the times you drove me to piano. All the times you drove me to basketball and hockey — that clearly didn’t work out. All the times you drove me to ‘Degrassi.’ No matter how long it took me to figure out what I wanted to do, you were always there to give me a ride, and now we’re on one hell of ride,” Drake said. Family bonding was a theme at the three-hour show, which aired live on NBC and was hosted by Kelly Clarkson Ciara’s young son and husband, NFL player Russell Wilson, danced along while she worked the stage, and Nick and Joe Jonas gave kisses to Priyanka Chopra and Sophie Turner of “Game of Thrones” fame when they sang in the audience before hitting the stage. Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco looked to his parents as he accepted top rock song, quoting the name of his current hit: “Hey look Ma, I made it!” Mariah Carey’s twins cheered her on as she sang a medley of her hits and accepted the Icon award. She was in diva form before taking the award from Jennifer Hudson, throwing her napkin on the floor after dabbing her face with it. “Without getting into all the drama, all the ups and downs of my career ... I guess I always felt like an outsider, someone who doesn’t quite belong anywhere, and I still feel like that lost interracial child who had a lot of nerve to believe I could succeed at anything at all in this world. But, and this is the truth, I did believe because I had to,” she said. “The truth is I dedicated my life to my music — my saving grace — and to my fans.” Cardi B, the night’s top nominee with 21, locked lips with husband Offset on the red carpet and the couple sat closely inside the venue. She won six awards, including top Hot 100 song for “Girls Like You” with Maroon 5. “I remember when Maroon 5 hit me up to do this song. I was like, ‘Bro I’m five months pregnant. I can’t even breathe.’ But this record to me was so amazing. I was like, ‘Oh this is going to be a hit.’ And now I sing this song to my daughter because she’s the girl that I need,” she said. Drake and Cardi B — who both won multiple awards during the live telecast — used their speeches to promote love and appreciation for their peers in the music industry. Others, too, brought on the positive energy when onstage. Imagine Dragons’ band leader Dan Reynolds used his speech to highlight the dangers of conversion therapy on LGBTQ youth. He earned rousing applause. Florida Georgia Line’s Tyler Hubbard followed suit, telling the audience after winning top country song: “In the spirit of so much truth being spoken tonight by so many talented artists, I think we should speak some truth.” “As artists we all get to experience so many unbelievable things, but in our opinion, at the end of the day, it’s all for nothing if you’re not using your platform for better ... to spread love, to help those in needs, to be a light to your community,” he said. Swift kicked off the show when she brought her new music video to life with a colorful, eye-popping performance of her song “ME!” Dancers wearing bright, pastel colors spun in the air holding umbrellas and a marching band kicked off Swift’s performance — like most of the world, maybe she was inspired by Beyonce’s new Coachella film? Madonna, wearing an eye-patch, teamed up with Colombian singer Maluma for a performance, but it was Grammy-winning Christian artist Lauren Daigle who had the night’s best performance. She sang “You Say,” giving the audience a calm, yet strong and powerful performance. She was backed by three awesome background singers and a pianist. BTS, who performed alongside Halsey, also had a major night. At the Billboard Awards and American Music Awards, the K-pop band had only previously won “social” awards based off their fanatic fan base, but on Wednesday BTS picked up top duo/group, besting Grammy-winning groups like Maroon 5, Imagine Dragons and Dan + Shay. “I still can’t believe we’re here on this stage with so many great artists,” RM said as fans screamed loudly. “We’re still the same boys from six years ago, we still have the same dreams ... we still have the same thoughts. Let us keep dreaming.” An unlikely winner at the Billboard Awards? “Game of Thrones” actress Maisie Williams, whose plays Arya Stark on the HBO series and shined brightly on last week’s episode. “Shout-out to Arya Stark for putting in that work last week,” Drake said onstage after winning his first award of the evening.

Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are officially single, though more work is left before the terms of their divorce are final. Los Angeles Superior Court documents show that Judge John W. Ouderkirk entered a judgment Friday, saying the couple is no longer married. Her name was also restored to just Jolie, not Jolie Pitt. The couple’s lawyers had asked for a bifurcated judgment, meaning that two married people can be declared single before all issues in the divorce are agreed upon. It’s not clear what issues remain unresolved in the divorce, but Jolie has filed papers saying Pitt wasn’t paying sufficient child support, which his attorneys disputed. The 43-year-old Jolie and the 55-year-old Pitt have six children. They were married in 2014, and Jolie filed for divorce in 2016.

                            Actress Amber Heard asked a judge Thursday to dismiss a $50 million defamation lawsuit her ex-husband Johnny Depp filed over an op-ed about domestic violence she wrote in The Washington Post, and provided new evidence toward her allegations of abuse.

In the motion filed in the Circuit Court of Fairfax, Virginia, Heard describes in new detail more than a dozen instances before and during their marriage when she says Depp slapped her, shoved her, pulled her hair or choked her. Depp has denied any such abuse. The allegations have appeared in the couple’s divorce and other legal fights.

Heard includes exhibits such as photos of her with bruises on her face and scars on her arms, images of damage she says Depp did to their home, and newly revealed screenshots of text messages describing the incidents at the time, and excerpts of her divorce deposition describing domestic abuse.

“Johnny Depp physically and verbally abused Amber Heard,” her attorney Eric George said in a statement. “Since their divorce, Mr. Depp has continued to publically harass Ms. Heard, and attempted to gaslight the world by denying his abuse. It is long past time for Mr. Depp’s despicable conduct to end.”

Depp’s lawsuit, filed last month, called the ongoing allegations of domestic abuse “categorically and demonstrably false.”

“They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career,” the lawsuit states, claiming that “she is the perpetrator.”

Depp’s attorney, Adam Waldman, said he was reviewing the new filing. He said previously that he and Depp looked forward to providing evidence that would clear Depp’s name.

The Post piece by Heard, published in December, does not mention Depp by name or describe any incidents, but it discusses the societal plight of those who speak up about domestic abuse.

“I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath,” the 32-year-old actress wrote, adding that she felt as though she was “on trial in the court of public opinion.”

But Depp’s lawsuit says it was clear Heard was talking about him, and that it worsened the damage the allegations had already done to his career.

The lawsuit states Depp, 55, has suffered financial losses because of the accusations, including being dropped from his role as Capt. Jack Sparrow in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” films.

Heard’s lawyers also argued that the lawsuit should be moved to Los Angeles because that’s where the relevant events took place and the court would be in a position to subpoena witnesses and find facts.

Heard first accused Depp of domestic violence in May 2016, the year after they were married. They were divorced in 2017.

The actress, whose credits include “Aquaman” and “Justice League,” met Depp on the set of their 2011 film “The Rum Diary.”

The couple posted an Instagram photo of their hands with a massive engagement ring on Lopez’s ring finger. The former Yankees shortstop captioned his photo with “she said yes” and a heart emoji.

The couple has been dating since early 2017 and later that year landed on the cover of Vanity Fair magazine with their celebrity couple nickname, J-Rod.

In January, Rodriguez told The Associated Press that he and Lopez had similar backgrounds and her latest film “Second Act” reflected the ties that drew them together.

“It really resembles a lot of the arc that Jennifer and I lived in our life: Both born in New York, both come from immigrant parents, both have two children, both Latino Americano — her from Puerto Rico, me from Dominican Republic. We’ve been through our ups and downs, but here we are in our 40s and trying to live the best lives possible and, at the same time, give back and pay it forward,” Rodriguez said.

It will be Lopez’s fourth marriage and Rodriguez’s second. Each has two children from previous marriages.

Facebook’s Zuckerberg was 23 when he hit the big B mark.

Jenner told Forbes the milestone is a “nice pat on the back.”

Detractors have wondered as the Jenner-Kardashian sibling climbed her way to a billionaire exactly what Forbes means by “self-made.” Her family, after all, is rich and famous. Her mom, Kris Jenner, helped build her business.

Forbes says as long as she didn’t inherit a business or money, she’s labeled self-made.

                            Actor Johnny Depp is suing his ex-wife, actress Amber Heard, in a $50 million defamation lawsuit, citing a piece she wrote for The Washington Post about domestic abuse.

“They were part of an elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity for Ms. Heard and advance her career,” the lawsuit said, claiming that “she is the perpetrator.”

The suit said Depp, 55, has suffered financial losses because of the accusations, including being dropped from his role as Capt. Jack Sparrow in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” films.

In her article, published in the Post in December, Heard also said she lost an acting role and contract with a major fashion brand because went public with her claims of abuse.

“I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath,” the 32-year-old actress wrote, adding that she felt as those she was “on trial in the court of public opinion.”

Heard’s publicists and attorney did not return phone calls or emails from The Associated Press seeking comment on Saturday.

In a statement to People magazine, her attorney Eric M. George called the lawsuit “frivolous” and “just the latest of Johnny Depp’s repeated efforts to silence Amber Heard.”

Depp’s attorney, Adam Waldman, responded to People that he and his client looked forward to presenting “overwhelming video, photographic and eyewitness evidence” that would clear Depp’s name.

Heard first accused Depp of domestic violence in May 2016, the year after they were married.

                            Billy Porter, speaking to Vogue before he walked the Oscars red carpet, knew what he was in for among some social media users:

“People are going to be really uncomfortable with my black ass in a ball gown, but it’s not anybody’s business but mine.”

The remark from the Tony-winning stage performer, actor and singer was both prescient and disproven. There was mega-praise for his velvet custom tuxedo look by Christian Siriano and outrage over the notion that an African American man in a dress was a threat to black masculinity.

It was just the conversation Porter had hoped to provoke, not to collect virulent hate but to help move along the idea that we all deserve respect, across racial lines and the gender divide.

“I was ready to create the conversation,” Porter told The Associated Press in a phone interview Monday the day after the Oscars. “We have to teach people how to treat us, we have to teach people how to love us, we have to teach people how to respect us, and the only way we do that is to respect ourselves.”

Porter, the black and gay breakout star of the boundary-expanding FX series “Pose,” spent awards season using fashion as political art, as he describes it. There were previous dresses, and there was help from powerhouses Tom Ford and Michael Kors in the later weeks, along with smaller designers who embrace a greater gender fluidity in their collections and were thrilled early on to dress him.

As a nominee at the Golden Globes, Porter’s custom trouser look by Randi Rahm, including a huge, hot pink-lined cape and floral embellishments, grabbed attention, but social media support and disdain after the 49-year-old took to the Oscars carpet took the debate into the stratosphere.

Porter understands where established notions of black masculinity originated, and he understands how toxic they can be. He and his stylist, Sam Ratelle, also realize how rigid gender-driven taboos can be and want to help the walls come down.

“It goes all the way back to the earliest of emasculations, which is slavery, so the only way to sort of overcome that is to be the strongest and the most masculine and the most powerful and now, what has become toxic,” Porter said. “And I don’t think it’s just black people. I think it’s men in general. Every ethnicity has their version of it.”

Porter couldn’t care less about negative comments.

“The comments are not my business. What people think about what I’m doing is not my business. I lived that already,” he said. “I’m inside of my authenticity and the whole point is that you have to respect me as much as I respect you. If you don’t like it, go somewhere else. You don’t have to look. It’s not about you. I don’t understand why my putting on a dress causes this much strife in your life.”

Ratelle said he began working with Porter about a year ago.

“He said, ‘I want to be a piece of walking art,’ and we just went from there,” Ratelle said. “It’s been really awesome to work with a bunch of great designers. Randi Rahm was certainly completely open. Issey Miyake was fantastic for the Radio City show (Porter was a study in white). Christian Siriano, the fact that he did this custom gown in one week, was incredible after saying, ‘Absolutely. There’s no question we’ll do this.’ Michael Kors has been the most gracious human. So has Tom Ford.”

Porter said he’s just getting started in terms of pushing along the conversation.

“People are actually listening,” he said. “I hope it opens up a dialogue of healing. I will always continue to do me. If there’s anything I’ve learned in the 49 years that I’ve lived on this planet, is that being authentic is the only version of the story that anybody should be.”

Porter has always been a fashion lover. This year, he was an ambassador for the Council of Fashion Designers of America for men’s fashion week in New York and attended a variety of shows featuring a variety of looks, from traditional to gender fluid.

Now that awards season is over, and the fashion week cycle is finishing up in Paris, Porter said he’ll continue to wear whatever he likes, with a great number of designers on board to help with pulls from their lines and custom outfits.

“Pre-Golden Globes it was difficult,” he said of options available to him, considering that he’s not sample size. “After the Golden Globes it has not been difficult. You work with the people who work with you. You walk through the doors that are open. I’m never a beggar.”

In real life, or at least on live TV during the Oscars, Helen Mirren appeared ready for change, noting that both she and her co-presenter, Jason Momoa, were dressed in pink.

“It just goes to show, doesn’t it, that these days a Hawaiian god and a very mature Englishwoman can actually wear the same color. We can both wear pink,” she said to claps.

Momoa agreed: “Finally. The times are changin’.”

Pelé was simply “The King.” He embraced “the beautiful game” of soccer in his 1958 World Cup debut for Brazil and never really let go.
He won a record three World Cups and was widely regarded as one of his sport’s greatest players. His majestic and galvanizing presence set him among the most recognizable figures in the world.
Pelé died Thursday at 82. He had undergone treatment for colon cancer since 2021.
Pelé was among the game’s most prolific scorers and spent nearly two decades enchanting fans and dazzling opponents. His grace, athleticism and moves on soccer’s highest stage transfixed all. He orchestrated a fast, fluid style of play that revolutionized the sport — a flair that personified Brazilian elegance on the field.
He carried his country to soccer’s heights and became a global ambassador for his sport in a journey that began on the streets of Sao Paulo state, where he would kick a sock stuffed with newspapers or rags.
“Pelé changed everything. He transformed football into art, entertainment,” Neymar, a fellow Brazilian soccer player, said on Instagram. “Football and Brazil elevated their standing thanks to the King! He is gone, but his magic will endure. Pelé is eternal!”
In the conversation about soccer’s greatest player, only the late Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are mentioned alongside him.
Different sources, counting different sets of games, list Pelé’s goal totals anywhere between 650 (league matches) to 1,281 (all senior matches, some against low-level competition). When Maradona once interviewed Pelé, he playfully asked the Brazilian how he accumulated so many goals.
The player who would be dubbed “The King” was introduced to the world at 17 at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, the youngest player ever at the tournament.
Pelé was the emblem of his country’s World Cup triumph of 1970 in Mexico. He scored in the final and set up Carlos Alberto with a nonchalant pass for the last goal in a 4-1 victory over Italy.
The image of Pelé in a bright-yellow Brazil jersey, with the No. 10 stamped on the back, remains alive with soccer fans everywhere. As does his trademark goal celebration — a leap with a right fist thrust high above his head.
Pelé’s fame was such that in 1967 factions of a civil war in Nigeria agreed to a brief cease-fire so he could play an exhibition match in the country. He was knighted by Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II in 1997. When Pelé visited Washington to help popularize the game in North America, it was the U.S. president who stuck out his hand first.
“You don’t need to introduce yourself because everyone knows who Pelé is,” Ronald Reagan said.
Pelé was Brazil’s first modern Black national hero but rarely spoke about racism in a country where the rich and powerful tend to hail from the white minority.
Opposing fans taunted Pelé with monkey chants at home and all over the world.
“He said that he would never play if he had to stop every time he heard those chants,” said Angelica Basthi, one of Pelé’s biographers. “He is key for Black people’s pride in Brazil, but never wanted to be a flagbearer.”
Pelé’s life after soccer took many forms. He was a politician — Brazil’s Extraordinary Minister for Sport — a wealthy businessman, and an ambassador for UNESCO and the United Nations.
He had roles in movies, soap operas and even composed songs and recorded CDs of popular Brazilian music.
Pelé was an ambassador for his sport until his final years but as his health deteriorated his travels and appearances became less frequent. After needing a hip replacement, he started using a cane.
He was often seen in a wheelchair during his final years and did not attend a ceremony to unveil a statue of him representing Brazil’s 1970 World Cup team.
“He gets very shy, he gets very embarrassed,” his son Edinho told Globoesporte.com. “He doesn’t want to go out.”
Pelé spent his 80th birthday with a few relatives.
Pelé spent a month hospitalized in 2021 after surgery to remove a tumor from his colon. Pelé said he was ready “to play 90 minutes, plus extra time,” but soon started chemotherapy.
Born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, in the small city of Tres Coracoes in the interior of Minas Gerais state on Oct. 23, 1940, Pelé grew up shining shoes to buy his modest soccer gear. His father was also a player.
Pelé’s talent drew notice when he was 11, and a local professional player brought him to Santos’ youth squads. Despite his youth and 5-foot-8 frame Pelé’ scored against grown men with the same ease he displayed against friends back home. He debuted with the Brazilian club at 15 in 1956, and the club quickly gained worldwide recognition.
The name Pelé came from him mispronouncing the name of a player called Bilé. He later became known simply as ‘O Rei’ – The King.
Pelé went to the 1958 World Cup as a reserve but became a key part for his country’s championship team. His first goal, in which he flicked the ball over the head of a defender and raced around him to volley it home, was voted as one of the best in World Cup history.
“When Pelé scored,” veteran Swedish midfielder Sigge Parling said, “I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding.”
The 1966 World Cup in England — won by the hosts — was a bitter one for Pelé, by then already considered the world’s top player. Brazil was knocked out at the group stage and Pelé, angry at fouls and hard tackles by Portugal, swore it was his last World Cup.
He changed his mind and was rejuvenated in the 1970 World Cup. In a game against England, he struck a header for a certain score, but the great goalkeeper Gordon Banks flipped the ball over the bar in an astonishing move. Pelé likened the save — one of the best in World Cup history — to a “salmon climbing up a waterfall.” Later, he scored the opening goal in the final against Italy, his last World Cup match.
In all, Pelé played 114 matches with Brazil, scoring a record 95 goals — including 77 in official matches. Most of his goals came with Santos, which he led to five national titles, two Copa Libertadores trophies and two club world championships — all in the 1960s.
His run with Santos stretched over three decades until he went into semi-retirement after the 1972 season. Wealthy European clubs tried to sign him, but the Brazilian government intervened to keep him from being sold, declaring him a national treasure.
On the field, Pelé’s energy, vision and imagination drove a gifted Brazilian national team, with intricate passing combinations slicing defenses while leaving room for players to showcase flashy skills.
The fast, fluid style of play exemplified “O Jogo Bonito” — Portuguese for “The Beautiful Game.” And at the center of it all, like a maestro in command of his orchestra, was Pelé. It was his 1977 autobiography, “My Life and the Beautiful Game,” that made the phrase part of soccer’s lexicon.
In 1975, he joined the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. Although he was past his prime at 34 years old, Pelé briefly gave soccer a higher profile in North America before ending his career on Oct. 1, 1977, in an exhibition between the Cosmos and Santos. Among the dignitaries on hand was perhaps the only other athlete whose renown spanned the globe — Muhammad Ali.
Pelé had two daughters out of wedlock and five children from his first two marriages, to Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi and Assiria Seixas Lemos. He later married businesswoman Marcia Cibele Aoki.

Pelé was simply “The King.” He embraced “the beautiful game” of soccer in his 1958 World Cup debut for Brazil and never really let go.
He won a record three World Cups and was widely regarded as one of his sport’s greatest players. His majestic and galvanizing presence set him among the most recognizable figures in the world.
Pelé died Thursday at 82. He had undergone treatment for colon cancer since 2021.
Pelé was among the game’s most prolific scorers and spent nearly two decades enchanting fans and dazzling opponents. His grace, athleticism and moves on soccer’s highest stage transfixed all. He orchestrated a fast, fluid style of play that revolutionized the sport — a flair that personified Brazilian elegance on the field.
He carried his country to soccer’s heights and became a global ambassador for his sport in a journey that began on the streets of Sao Paulo state, where he would kick a sock stuffed with newspapers or rags.
“Pelé changed everything. He transformed football into art, entertainment,” Neymar, a fellow Brazilian soccer player, said on Instagram. “Football and Brazil elevated their standing thanks to the King! He is gone, but his magic will endure. Pelé is eternal!”

Sri Lanka’s inexperienced cricket team overcame a poor start with bat and ball to put on an impressive all-round show Sunday and win the Asia Cup for the sixth time with a 23-run victory over Pakistan.
Bhanuka Rajapaksa hit an unbeaten 71 off 45 balls in Dubai and led Sri Lanka as it recovered from 58-5 to reach 170-6 in the final after Pakistan won the toss and elected to field.
Pakistan crashed to 147 all out off the last balls as its top order continued to struggle against the pace with fast bowler Pramod Madushan claiming 4-34 in only his second T20 international.
Leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga then baffled the lower order with his sharp googlies to accelerate Pakistan’s collapse.
Hasaranga, who earlier scored 36 off 21 balls, had Pakistan’s top-scorer Mohammad Rizwan (55) caught in the deep in his last over before claiming the wickets of Asif Ali and Khushdil Shah in the same over to finish with 3-27.
“It was all about nerves, I knew the youngsters can always deliver,” Sri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka said. “We have players with good caliber, and they stood up well.”
Sri Lanka had an awful bowling start when left-arm fast bowler Dilshan Madushanka conceded nine runs through a no ball and several wides before the 21-year-old’s first legitimate delivery at the sixth attempt.
Madushan, who made his T20 debut in the last Super 4 match against Pakistan on Friday, settled his team’s nerves quickly by claiming the wickets of Babar Azam (5) and Fakhar Azam (0) off successive deliveries inside the powerplay.
Babar was brilliantly snapped up by Madushanka over his head at short fine leg off a hard flick and Fakhar went for a golden duck by dragging the first ball onto his stumps.
Babar, the second-ranked T20 batter, ended the tournament with only 68 runs in six games.
“As a batting unit we didn’t perform according to our potential,” Babar said. “We didn’t finish the way we would have wanted to and gave away 15-20 extra runs … the more you learn from these ups-and-downs is good, but you need to reduce your mistakes.”
Rizwan and Iftikhar Ahmed (32) added 71 runs for the third wicket in almost 10 overs as Sri Lanka kept mounting the pressure by bowling tidily in the middle overs.
Madushan broke the stand in his return spell as Pakistan collapsed from 102-3 to lose its last seven wickets for 45 runs with Sri Lanka fielders holding onto all their catches.
Earlier, Pakistan’s fearsome pace attack, led by Haris Rauf (3-29), had Sri Lanka in trouble inside the first nine overs before Rajapaksa and Hasaranga led the recovery.
Rajapaksa hit six fours and three sixes in his innings.
Fast bowler Naseem Shah (1-40) had Kusal Mendis clean bowled off the first ball with a stunning inswinging delivery while Rauf dismissed Pathum Nissanka and Danushka Gunathilaka.
But Rajapaksa and Hasaranga counterattacked after having negotiated the spin threat of Shadab Khan (1-28). Surprisingly Babar used his premium left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz for only one over which went for three runs as both Sri Lanka batters cut loose against the pace of Shah and Mohammad Hasnain (0-41).
Pakistan was scrappy in the field as Rajapaksa was dropped either side of his half century by Shadab in the deep. Rauf had Hasaranga caught behind in the 15th over, but Rajapaksa added a further 54 runs in the last five overs with Chamika Karunaratne, who made 14 not out.
Rajapaksa provided Sri Lanka with a late flourish when he smashed Shah for a boundary off the penultimate ball and then smashed a six over extra cover to give Sri Lanka a strong total to defend.
Sri Lanka made a stunning comeback with five successive wins in the tournament after getting beaten by Afghanistan in its opening game. Sri Lanka also beat Pakistan in the last Super 4 game.

Mislav Oršić must wish he could play English teams every week.
The Croatia forward ran from the halfway line and produced a deft finish in the 13th minute to lead Dinamo Zagreb to a surprising 1-0 win over Chelsea in their opening Group E match in the Champions League on Tuesday.
Add that goal to Oršić’s feats against English clubs in the Europa League: a winner against West Ham last season and a hat trick to eliminate Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham in 2020-21.
It marked a memorable start by Dinamo to its first group-stage campaign in Europe’s top competition since 2019-20, having reached this point by coming through three qualifying rounds.
As for Chelsea, it was the latest disappointing result in an unconvincing start to the season for a club that spent nearly $300 million on refreshing its squad in the summer transfer window.
The two-time European champions dominated the match in the Croatian capital but were let down by poor finishing, which dovetailed with scrambling defense and some great saves by Dominik Livaković for the hosts.
“We are clearly not where we need to be, or where we can be,” said Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel, whose team has already lost to Leeds and Southampton in the Premier League.
Asked specifically what he didn’t like about Chelsea’s performance, Tuchel said: “At the moment, everything is missing.”
In the second half, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang — making his debut for Chelsea after a deadline-day move from Barcelona and wearing a mask to protect his injured cheek — had a goal disallowed for a narrow offside against Ben Chilwell in the build-up. Then, in a frantic finish, Reece James smashed a shot against the post before Livaković made a stunning double stop to deny Mason Mount then Hakim Ziyech.
Ultimately, the smash-and-grab win was earned thanks to the early goal by Oršić, who met a headed flick-on by Bruno Petković in midfield by chesting the ball forward inside his own half past Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana and racing clear of the newly signed French defender toward goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.
As he approached Kepa, Oršić lifted the ball over the keeper and it bobbled into the net.
Dinamo looked dangerous in the rare attacks it had in a performance underpinned by defensive discipline and, from one counterattack, Stefan Ristovski powered in a rising shot that was tipped onto the crossbar by Kepa, who was selected ahead of Edouard Mendy.
“It’s an underperformance from us,” Tuchel said. “We have the same story as always — we have an OK start, we don’t finish our half-chances, we don’t feel it when the game is already there to put to bed in the first 15-20 minutes, then we concede one counter-attack which is far too easy.
“And from there, we struggled.”

Remember that time, not so long ago, when there was a crisis at Manchester United?
After four straight wins, it seems like a dim and distant memory.
The latest sign that United is well on the road to recovery came on Sunday with a 3-1 win over Arsenal, whose 100% start to the season came crashing to an end.
There were still anti-Glazer chants inside and outside Old Trafford — it feels like they are here to stay, whether the team wins or loses — but they are now accompanied by frequent and jubilant roars for goals.
Two of them were scored in the second half by Marcus Rashford to sweep United to victory after Arsenal pulled it back to 1-1 through Bukayo Saka, but the opening goal felt the most significant.
Antony, United’s latest big signing from Ajax for $95 million, marked his first match in English soccer with a goal from a curling, first-time finish in the 35th minute, crowning a performance that featured a slew of jinks, feints and exaggerated stepovers that thrilled home fans. He came off in the 58th to a standing ovation to be replaced by Cristiano Ronaldo, who again had to settle for a starting spot on the bench.
Since that humiliating 4-0 loss at Brentford that sparked a crisis and some doubts around the wisdom of hiring Erik ten Hag as manager, United has beaten Liverpool, Southampton, Leicester and now Arsenal, the league leader.
After six games, United is only three points behind Arsenal and two behind Manchester City, the title favorite.
How quickly things have turned around.

Manchester United secured its third straight win in the Premier League by beating Leicester 1-0 on Thursday, with Cristiano Ronaldo again only making a late appearance off the bench.
Jadon Sancho finished off a flowing move on the break for the only goal of the game in the 23rd minute as United’s players backed up victories over Liverpool and Southampton to put their early-season crisis behind them.
“It is another step forward,” United manager Erik ten Hag said.
It was only 10 days ago that United went into its home game against Liverpool on the back of back-to-back defeats to open the season with doubts swirling around the suitability of Ten Hag — its recently hired coach from Ajax — and his new signings.
Those doubts have pretty much disappeared, with United playing with more confidence and the additions of Casemiro — a second-half substitute like Ronaldo — and Antony — who wasn’t available after completing his move from Ajax on Thursday — strengthening the team. Back-to-back clean sheets is a big positive, too.
Ronaldo might yet play a significant part this season after failing to secure a move away in the transfer market that shut soon after the full-time whistle. He came on in the 68th minute and looked lively, an acrobatic bicycle kick flying just wide.
“Once we have Cristiano Ronaldo and Casemiro getting fitter, it will get better still,” Ten Hag said. “We need not only a team, we need a squad.”
In the end, Sancho’s goal separated the teams and it came after United claimed possession following a Leicester goal kick. Bruno Fernandes found Marcus Rashford in a central position and he slipped in Sancho, who rounded goalkeeper Danny Ward and slotted the ball into an empty net.
Leicester is now the Premier League’s crisis club, with just one point from its first five games and two points adrift in last place. The pressure is rising on its manager, Brendan Rodgers, who grumbled after the match about the club’s failure to strengthen the squad in the summer transfer.
Leicester only signed one outfield player, unheralded defender Wout Faes from French club Reims, and he only arrived on deadline day to fill the gap left by the departure of Wesley Fofana to Chelsea.
“With the greatest respect,” Rodgers said, “we have not had the help in the market this team needed.”
The hosts only seriously threatened United goalkeeper David De Gea once and that was from a free kick, which James Maddison whipped over the defensive wall and brought out a fine one-handed save. James Justin blazed over in stoppage time with Leicester’s other good chance.
United will face a bigger challenge on Sunday, when Arsenal — with its 100% record — visits Old Trafford.
“It is a good test to see where we are,” Ten Hag said.

Erling Haaland is taking English soccer by storm.
Back-to-back hat tricks. Nine goals in five games. No player has ever made as good a start to the Premier League as the towering Norway striker.
Haaland’s latest three-goal haul came in the first half of City’s 6-0 thrashing of Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, three days after achieving the same feat in the second half against Crystal Palace.
City was banking on Haaland being the heir to long-time striker Sergio Aguero and it’s already looking as if that is the case.
Aguero previously held the record for most goals in a player’s first five Premier League appearances, with eight along with former Coventry striker Mick Quinn (from the early 1990s). Haaland has bettered that, and surely more scoring records will fall if he continues like this.
For example, can he become the first player to score 40 goals in a single top-flight campaign in England since Tottenham’s Jimmy Greaves in 1960-61?
“What Haaland wants is to win titles,” Guardiola said of the striker who scored with his left foot, right foot and head against Forest. “Knowing him, he would not be happy to break records if we don’t win titles.
“Sergio is a legend — no one can break his position in the hearts of Man City fans. But Erling has the quality to be there.”
City is the red-hot favorite to win the Premier League again with Haaland leading the line and is unbeaten with four wins from five games.
Even its back-up striker is scoring, with Julian Alvarez — an offseason arrival from River Plate — marking his first start with two goals in the second half. Joao Cancelo also scored with a blast from outside the box.
Still, the champions aren’t top. That honor remains with Arsenal.
PERFECT START
Arsenal has matched its best ever start to a Premier League season after securing a fifth straight win to open the season by beating Aston Villa 2-1.
Gabriel Martinelli’s 77th-minute goal clinched victory at Emirates Stadium after Arsenal was pegged back by conceding a goal straight from a corner by Douglas Luiz, who did the same in an English League Cup match last week, too.
That came against the run of play, with Arsenal dominating the game but only having Gabriel Jesus’ 30th-minute goal — his third of the season — to show for it.
“That is the spirit we need to keep for the whole season,” Martinelli said.
Villa has lost four of its five games, leaving manager Steven Gerrard under pressure.
LATE, LATE GOAL
Liverpool is battling hard to keep up with the fierce pace set by Arsenal and City, needing a goal in the eighth minute of stoppage time by Fábio Carvalho to claim a dramatic 2-1 win over Newcastle.
Alexander Isak gave Newcastle the lead in the 38th on his debut following a move from Real Sociedad on Friday for a club-record fee and was denied a second goal by narrow offside call.
Roberto Firmino swept in a finish from Mohamed Salah’s cross to equalize before a penalty-box melee following a corner saw the ball pop up off the shoulder of Salah, and Carvalho — a summer signing from Fulham — reacted quickest to smash into the roof of the net.
“I am not sure everyone in the stadium kept believing but from now on we have to,” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said. “What a wonderful goal from the little one.”
It was a second straight victory for Liverpool, which opened the season without winning any of its first three games.
SPURS UNBEATEN
Tottenham remained unbeaten after a 1-1 draw at West Ham, for whom club-record signing Lucas Paqueta missed a chance to score a late winner on his debut.
West Ham manager David Moyes said before kickoff that Paqueta had not so much as passed a ball to his new teammates after only completing his 52 million pound ($61.6 million) switch from Lyon on Monday.
With four minutes remaining, Vladimir Coufal pulled the ball back and Paqueta — on as a 67th-minute substitute — got in a mix-up with fellow new signing Emerson Palmieri as they left the ball to each other, 10 meters from goal, instead of taking a shot. Moyes fell to his knees on the touchline.
An own-goal from Thilo Kehrer gave Tottenham the lead before Tomas Soucek equalized.
In the other game, Bournemouth drew 0-0 at home to Wolverhampton, two days after firing manager Scott Parker.

Erling Haaland scored his first Premier League hat-trick as Manchester City came from two goals down to beat Crystal Palace 4-2 on Saturday.
City trailed 2-0 after just 21 minutes against a clinical Palace side — which was looking to its 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium last season — after an own-goal by John Stones and a header by Joachim Andersen.
It was the fourth Premier League game out of the last six in which City had fallen two goals behind, but Pep Guardiola’s team had not lost any of the previous three and went on to win this one in style.
After Bernardo Silva pulled one back eight minutes into the second half, Haaland took over as his first home goals for City came in a hurry. He netted three in the space of 20 minutes to make it six in his first four Premier League matches.
Patrick Vieira was forced to name a starting 11 without Wilfried Zaha due to injury, but the absence of the star forward did not prevent Palace from storming into an early lead as Eberechi Eze’s free kick struck both Kyle Walker and Stones as it spun into the net.
Things got worse for City in the 22nd minute from another set piece. It was Eze again with a corner from which Andersen was left unmarked to power in a header.
Guardiola had been planning two substitutions early in the second half with Ilkay Gundogan and Julian Alvarez both stripped and ready to go, but they sat back down after Silva got City back into it in the 53rd minute.
The Portugal international cut in from the right before hitting a low shot which deflected off Jeffrey Schlupp on its way in.
Gundogan and Alvarez did come on just after the hour and Alvarez quickly made an impact as City leveled in the 62nd. He flicked on a deep cross to Phil Foden, who chipped the ball back in for Haaland, who got across Marc Guehi to head in his first Etihad goal.
Eight minutes later he had his second. From a short corner, Alvarez fed Silva who pulled the ball back for Stones and he rolled it across for Haaland to poke home from a yard out.
Haaland sealed his hat-trick with 10 minutes to go. Silva’s through ball found his run perfectly, and the Norwegian had the strength to hold off Joel Ward before firing into the bottom corner.
City now has 10 points from four games, with Palace left on four points.

Raheem Sterling’s first goals for Chelsea gave the 10-man Blues a 2-1 victory over winless Leicester in the English Premier League on Saturday.
Sterling’s second half double proved decisive at Stamford Bridge as the hosts overcame the early sending off of England midfielder Conor Gallagher.
Manager Thomas Tuchel was also absent as he was serving a touchline ban following his confrontation with Antonio Conte in the opening home match against Tottenham, while Gallagher was dismissed in the 28th minute after getting two yellow cards.
Chelsea was awarded an early penalty when Ruben Loftus-Cheek went down in the box, but referee Paul Tierney overturned his decision after Kai Havertz was adjudged to have been offside in the buildup.
Seven minutes before the break, the visitors thought they took the lead when Harvey Barnes headed home, but the effort was ruled out for a foul on Blues goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.
The hosts came close to breaking the deadlock four minutes later when Reece James struck the post with an effort from Sterling’s cross, then Jamie Vardy shot wide at the other end after good work by Youri Tielemans.
A little more than a minute after the restart, Sterling broke the deadlock with a shot from the edge of the area, after being found by Marc Cucurella.
The Blues, who introduced Cesar Azpilicueta at halftime, went from four at the back to three and looked more threatening.
They doubled their lead in the 63rd minute when Sterling tapped in James’ cross at the far post. However, the Foxes pulled one back three minutes later when Barnes beat Mendy at his near post.
Vardy fired a shot into the side-netting and Ayoze Perez came close as the visitors sought an equalizer. However, Chelsea held on for its first home win.
Leicester defender Wesley Fofana was left out of Brendan Rodgers’ squad amid reports he is close to finalizing a transfer to Chelsea.

Liverpool equaled the biggest win in English Premier League history after a 9-0 hammering of promoted Bournemouth on Saturday.
Jurgen Klopp’s side started the campaign slowly, with surprise draws against Fulham and Crystal Palace compounded by Monday’s loss at rival Manchester United. But Liverpool’s fearsome attack looked back to its best at Anfield as the team recorded its first league win and Roberto Firmino and Luis Diaz both grabbed two goals.
It’s only the fifth time a team scored nine goals in the league, with Man United (twice) and Leicester the only previous teams to win 9-0.
Firmino, starting in place of suspended summer signing Darwin Nunez, produced a stunning first-half display, which began with Diaz heading home his clipped cross within three minutes of the kickoff.
Firmino then provided the assist for Harvey Elliott’s first league goal — a fizzing strike from distance that would have been goal of the day were it not for the Trent Alexander-Arnold stunner that followed.
The Brazil forward set up that goal and celebrated one of his own soon after when turning in a deflected cross -- his first league goal at Anfield since December 2020.
Virgil van Dijk powered home Liverpool’s fifth on the stroke of halftime, while the onslaught continued just after the break in the form of Chris Mepham’s own-goal.
Firmino grabbed a second of the afternoon before leaving to a standing ovation.
The goals did not stop there, though, as Fabio Carvalho scored his first for the club and Diaz grabbed his second.

Manchester United’s stand-in captain Bruno Fernandes made it back-to-back wins for Erik ten Hag’s team by scoring the only goal in a 1-0 victory over Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday.
Wearing the captain’s armband in place of the still-benched Harry Maguire, Fernandes steered in a cross from Diogo Dalot in the 55th minute as United followed up Monday’s win over Liverpool with another morale-boosting performance.
Having started the season with two straight losses — including a 4-0 drubbing at Brentford — United has now won consecutive league matches for the first time since February.
It was also the team’s first clean sheet of the season, thanks in part to David de Gea’s reflex save to keep out a header from Joe Aribo in the 66th.
It’s a result that will give a bit more breathing space to Ten Hag, the Dutch manager who faced a torrent of criticism and skepticism after the team’s dismal start to the campaign.
Ten Hag’s decisions to leave Maguire and star forward Cristiano Ronaldo on the bench were vindicated once again, with center-back pairing Lisandro Martinez and Raphael Varane looking solid in defense.
United did struggle to create quality chances in the first half, although Ten Hag was shaking his head in disbelief that his team didn’t go ahead in the 20th minute when they had three shots on goal from close range in the span of a few seconds.
Anthony Elanga’s effort from a tight angle was saved by goalkeeper Gavin Bazunu before Fernandes and Christian Eriksen both had their follow-up shots blocked by diving defenders.
Southampton had its best first-half chance on the half-hour mark when a corner fell to Armel Bella-Kotchap at the back post, but he lifted it over the crossbar.
United started stronger in the second half and got the goal after a well-worked move down the right flank. Dalot lifted a cross into the area and Fernandes was on hand to sidefoot it inside the far post.
Ronaldo and United’s new signing Casemiro — the Portugal star’s former teammate at Real Madrid — both came on in the second half.
Substitute Sekou Mara had two chances to equalize for Southampton in injury time, but his spectacular overhead kick was blocked by Dalot and he sidefooted another effort wide of the post a minute later.

Finally, there are signs of life at Manchester United.
Against a backdrop of protests against the club’s ownership, United delivered a performance of intensity and spirit to beat fierce rival Liverpool 2-1 on Monday and claim its first points in the Premier League this season.
Composed finishes by Jadon Sancho in the 16th minute and Marcus Rashford in the 53rd earned a victory at Old Trafford that will bring some respite for under-pressure manager Erik ten Hag, who made a huge statement in his team selection by dropping star striker Cristiano Ronaldo and club captain Harry Maguire and was validated.
“I wanted a different attitude and that is what I saw them bring on the pitch,” said Ten Hag, who has started his tenure at United amid something of a crisis at England’s biggest club. “But it’s only the start.”
Suddenly, the heat is on Liverpool — widely expected to be a title contender again this season — with Jürgen Klopp’s team still waiting for a win after three games and now languishing behind United in the standings on just two points.
Mohamed Salah scored an 81st-minute consolation but it was another below-par display from Liverpool after draws with Fulham and Crystal Palace, even if this was a first league loss in 2022.
“In the warm-up, it was the quietest I have heard this stadium and they wanted something to lift them,” Liverpool defender Andrew Robertson said. “And we gave them it.”
What is historically the biggest game in English soccer was preceded by a pre-match protest by thousands of United fans angry at the direction and state of the club under its owners of 17 years, the Glazer family.
The supporters called for the U.S-based Glazers to sell the club as they walked to Old Trafford then gathered on the concourse outside the storied stadium, in front of a large police presence. Many lingered as the match began.
The pressure was on United after losses to Brighton (2-1) and Brentford (4-0) to open the season, and the players fed off a frenzied atmosphere that seemed to affect Liverpool early on.
“The start of the game was exactly what everyone expected, what United fans expected. They were after us,” Klopp said. “They started slightly more aggressive than us.”
Lisandro Martinez, an offseason signing at center back who has come under enormous criticism in recent days, was particularly impressive and set the tone by clattering into Salah in the first minute, then barging into the Liverpool forward after getting up off the ground. Later in the first half, Raphael Varane, who replaced Maguire, virtually rugby-tackled Luis Diaz to the ground, to roars of approval from United’s fans even if it earned him a booking.
Sancho’s goal came in United’s best spell of the game, the winger showing great composure to trick James Milner by feigning to shoot, cut back inside and place a shot into the corner as Virgil van Dijk bizarrely stood motionless in front of him. It was the seventh straight Premier League match that Liverpool had fallen behind.
The stadium erupted again when Anthony Martial, a halftime substitute, played through Rashford and the striker sprinted toward the area before placing a calm finish inside the near post.
United had to defend stoutly at times but hung on to end an eight-match winless run against Liverpool and a losing streak of four matches in the league stretching back to the end of last season.
It’s down to United to string a run of similar battling performances together, starting at Southampton next weekend. Ten Hag will have Casemiro, whose $60 million signing from Real Madrid was completed Monday, available for that game and the Brazil midfielder was presented on the field before kickoff.
With more signings potentially arriving before the end of the transfer window, things might be looking up for the record 20-time English champions.
“We just have to produce like today in every single game,” Sancho said.

Manchester City was given a major scare by Newcastle before coming from behind to draw 3-3 in a thrilling Premier League game on Sunday.
City needed goals in the space of four minutes after the hour mark from Erling Haaland and Bernardo Silva to salvage a point at St. James’ Park and maintain the unbeaten start to its title defense.
Newcastle battered City for much of the first half and just after halftime, responding to going behind to Ilkay Gundogan’s fifth-minute strike with goals from Miguel Almiron, Callum Wilson and then a stunning free kick from Kieran Trippier in the 54th.
Rather than opt for damage limitation, Newcastle — inspired by the individual brilliance of Allan Saint-Maximin — decided attack was the best form of defense and it nearly paid off.
Ultimately it was a goal by Silva, starting for the first time in the league this season after being linked with a move to Barcelona in the summer, that saved City and it came off a brilliant through-ball from Kevin De Bruyne that took out three Newcastle players — going through the legs of one of them.
Newcastle also stayed unbeaten after three games and, funded by the riches of Saudi Arabia, will be proud of a statement display against the champions.
City started strongly, and Silva and Haaland had already combined ominously to allow Rodri to whistle a long-range strike over Nick Pope’s crossbar when the midfielder was allowed time and space to deliver a cross for Gundogan to control and fire past Pope.
The England goalkeeper had to save with his legs from De Bruyne and Phil Foden in quick succession with the visitors utterly dominant, although the home side should have leveled when Saint-Maximin cut the ball back for Almiron, who skied his shot.
Then Newcastle took over. Ederson had to save at full stretch to keep out Saint-Maximin before substitute Ruben Dias — on for the injured Nathan Ake — deflected Wilson’s attempt wide.
The respite proved temporary. Saint-Maximin tricked his way past Kyle Walker and Rodri down the left to cross to the far post where Almiron slid in to turn the ball home. The goal was ruled offside but it was overturned on review.
That Almiron was the scorer was poignant, given he was mocked by City midfielder Jack Grealish in post-title celebrations in May.
Joao Cancelo had to come to Ederson’s rescue after he had rashly raced from his line to confront Almiron and was easily rounded, but the Brazil goalkeeper was picking the ball out of his net once again six minutes before the break. Saint-Maximin cut inside and fed Wilson, who touched the ball back inside past Dias before dispatching it into the net with the outside of his right foot.
Haaland was unfortunate not to drag the visitors back level within seven minutes of the restart when his shot was tipped onto the foot of a post by Pope, and his misery was compounded two minutes later when the home side extended their lead.
John Stones was penalized for bringing down the flying Saint-Maximin 22 meters out and Trippier’s free kick gave Ederson little chance.
Haaland blasted City back into it from close range from Rodri’s flick back into the area and should have helped himself to a second three minutes later, but was denied by Pope’s legs.
City was level, however, seconds later when De Bruyne picked out Silva’s run.
Trippier was shown a straight red card by referee Jarred Gillett for a cynical trip on De Bruyne, but the official was advised to review the incident and reduced the punishment to a yellow.

A bad error by goalkeeper Edouard Mendy prompted a collapse by Chelsea in a 3-0 loss at Leeds on Sunday featuring a first Premier League goal by American winger Brenden Aaronson.
The late sending-off of center back Kalidou Koulibaly completed a miserable afternoon at a lively Elland Road for Chelsea, which fell to a first loss of the season.
It was Aaronson who applied pressure on Mendy after the Senegal international received a back pass in the 33rd minute. Mendy took a slightly heavy touch and tried to go around Aaronson, who dispossessed him and walked the ball into the net to make it 1-0.
Rodrigo glanced home a header from Jack Harrison’s free kick in the 37th minute and the roles were reversed for the third goal in the 69th, when Rodrigo arrived in the area to meet a cross with a mis-hit shot that was turned in from close range by Harrison.
Koulibaly, one of Chelsea’s offseason signings, received his second yellow card in the 84th for pulling back the jersey of substitute Joe Gelhardt.
Chelsea’s poor performance contrasted sharply with its impressive display in a 2-2 draw with Tottenham last weekend and highlighted a number of weaknesses in its squad.
Notably in attack, where manager Thomas Tuchel looks to be short after letting go Romelu Lukaku and Timo Werner and only bringing in Raheem Sterling from Manchester City. Sterling had a goal disallowed in the first half and also missed a great early chance.
Chelsea also has a shortage of center backs — the suspension of Koulibaly won’t help — as well as issues in midfield, with N’Golo Kante and Mateo Kovacic injured.
Leeds has opened with two wins and a draw in manager Jesse Marsch’s first full season in charge.
Spain striker Rodrigo has four goals, making him the top scorer in the league.

Two glaring misses then a red card for a reckless headbutt.
It was a home debut to forget for Liverpool’s big offseason signing, Darwin Núñez.
Fortunately for the Reds, another South American came to the rescue at Anfield as a dazzling individual goal by Luis Díaz salvaged a 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Monday.
In his first competitive start for Liverpool, Núñez lost control after jostling with Joachim Andersen off the ball and thrust his head into the face of the Palace defender, with referee Paul Tierney watching on close by in the 57th minute.
The red card was immediately brandished and Núñez had to be calmed down by his teammates as he attempted to confront Tierney. Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp blanked Núñez as the Uruguay striker headed down the tunnel.
“It’s a red card,” Klopp said. “He was provoked all the time but that is not how to behave.”
Núñez, an offseason signing from Benfica, earned his first start after a couple of impressive, goalscoring displays off the bench in the Community Shield against Manchester City and then against Fulham, and also because Roberto Firmino was missing through injury.
He missed a very presentable early chance against Palace by miscuing a close-range volley at the back post, and then hit the post from a similar range in the final minute of the first half.
Maybe some frustration had set by the time he was red-carded. As they jostled at the edge of Palace’s penalty area, Núñez threw his head back at Andersen and missed. Then, when confronted moments later by the aggrieved defender, Núñez turned into Andersen and butted him square in the face.
Already trailing because of Wilfried Zaha’s 32nd-minute goal, Liverpool was really up against it. But even down to 10 men, Klopp’s team still dominated possession and Díaz earned his team a point by cutting in from the left, slipping between two defenders, and curling a shot into the far corner in front of the Kop. The Colombia international’s goal came four minutes after the red card.
“Sometimes you need a moment of brilliance,” Liverpool midfielder James Milner said, “and when you have players like Luis on the pitch, he can create something out of nothing. It was an incredible goal.”
Palace relied almost exclusively on the counterattack throughout the match and it was from that means that Zaha opened the scoring, breaking the offside trap to latch onto Eberechi Eze’s through-ball and curl a finish into the far corner.
Zaha missed a great chance to snatch a win when he stretched to meet a cross late in the game and hit the post.
Liverpool has now drawn its first two games — Klopp’s team was held 2-2 by Fulham in the opening weekend — and is already four points behind Manchester City and Arsenal, the early pacesetters.
Its third match will be at Old Trafford next Monday against a beleaguered Manchester United team that has lost both of its games.
Núñez will be suspended for that, while Klopp is set to be without a slew of key players, with the likes of Thiago Alcantara, Diogo Jota, Ibrahima Konaté and Joel Matip currently out injured. Firmino missed the game as a precaution, according to Liverpool, so could be fit in a week’s time.
“Everything went against us during the week,” Klopp said. “It was crazy — it was like a witch was in the building. Every time somebody else had problems and then putting in such a performance, especially in the circumstances, I’m really proud.”

Antonio Conte and Thomas Tuchel were both sent off after clashing following the final whistle of a feisty 2-2 draw between Chelsea and Tottenham featuring an equalizer in the sixth minute of stoppage time by Spurs striker Harry Kane on Sunday.
As they shook hands on the field, Tuchel seemed to not let go of his grip and intimated that Conte look him in the eyes. Pushing and shoving ensued, just as there had been between the two managers in the technical area during the match at Stamford Bridge. They were then shown red cards.
Conte celebrated Tottenham’s first equalizer, by Pierre-Emile Højbjerg in the 68th minute, by barging into the chest of Tuchel, sparking a melee among the two sets of coaching staff.
Then, after Reece James put Chelsea back in front in the 77th, Tuchel set off on a sprint past Conte and down the touchline, clenching his fist in pure delight.
Kane’s goal came in the sixth of seven added-on minutes, the striker glancing in a header that took a touch off the thigh of James before going into the net.
Kalidou Koulibaly had put Chelsea ahead in the 19th minute by meeting a deep corner from Marc Cucurella with a stunning volley that flew high into the net for his first goal since joining in the offseason from Napoli.
Tottenham, which only came to life after the introduction of Richarlison, ended a run of five straight losses to Chelsea in all competitions but remained stuck on just one victory at Stamford Bridge since the Premier League started in 1992.
Both teams have four points from two games.

Manchester United plumbed new depths with a 4-0 loss at Brentford on Saturday to send Erik ten Hag’s team into meltdown after just two games of the Premier League season.
Through a mixture of defensive ineptitude and Brentford’s opportunism, United was 4-0 down at halftime for the first time in a Premier League game.
Mistakes by goalkeeper David De Gea gifted the first two goals to Josh Dasilva and Mathias Jensen, Ben Mee nodded in the third at a corner and Bryan Mbeumo hit a slick fourth on the counterattack on a chastening afternoon for the visitors.
Ten Hag, who joined from Ajax in the offseason, had insisted before the game that he was not panicking despite United’s lack of new signings but the Dutchman must be worried about this humiliating result, coming a week after a 2-1 home loss to Brighton.
It was a defeat largely of United’s own making.
Ten Hag had turned to Cristiano Ronaldo to lead the attack, having started the Portugal star on the bench against Brighton.
But the problems were all at the other end, as United imploded after only 10 minutes thanks to the first mistake from De Gea.
The Spaniard allowed Dasilva’s weak long-range shot to squirm through his hands and roll into the net.
De Gea was at fault again eight minutes later, passing to the under-pressure Christian Eriksen as United attempted to play out from the back.
Jensen was alive to the unravelling situation in the United defense and nipped in to rob Eriksen, cut inside and double the lead.
It was a sweet moment for the Bees fans, with Eriksen having spent the second half of last season with Brentford following his recovery from cardiac arrest, only to opt for supposed bigger and better things at United.
It certainly does not look like panning out that way for the Denmark international just yet.
The drinks break in sweltering conditions gave Ten Hag the chance to try to sort out the mess unfolding in front of him, while Bees boss Thomas Frank brought out a tactics board.
There was no change and on the half hour, Mee, an offseason signing from Burnley, bundled in a header at the far post after United failed to deal with a corner headed back into the danger area by Ivan Toney.
Five minutes later, Toney was given space to race forward down the left and tee up strike partner Mbeumo, who beat Luke Shaw before firing home.
With the heat undoubtedly a factor, United got some respite in the second half and Eriksen managed a couple of attempts on goal — a header held by goalkeeper David Raya and a volley skewed wide — both to loud cheers from the partying Brentford fans.

Gabriel Jesus didn’t take long to make an impression at the Emirates stadium.
The Brazil striker marked his home debut for Arsenal with two goals and two assists in a 4-2 win against Leicester in the Premier League on Saturday.
Jesus, who joined from Manchester City as Arsenal’s marquee summer signing so far, opened his account for the Gunners in the 23rd minute with a brilliant, curling finish. He got his second in the 35th from a header and had several chances to finish the game at Emirates Stadium with a hat trick.
The two times Leicester found itself back in the match, Arsenal responded right away.
The visitors made it 2-1 from an own goal by William Saliba in the 53rd, but Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka restored the home side’s two-goal cushion two minutes later. Xhaka scored after Jesus poked a loose ball into his path after Leicester goalkeeper Danny Ward failed to hold on to a routine cross into the box and collided with defender Wesley Fofana.
Leicester attacking midfielder James Maddison made it 3-2 in the 74th when he sent a low shot through the legs of Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale.
A nervous murmur went through the crowd, but the Arsenal team didn’t panic as it did in similar situations in recent seasons. Jesus drove forward just a minute later and squared the ball to forward Gabriel Martinelli, who fired a left-footed shot from just outside the area to beat Ward at the back post to make it 4-2.
Leicester also had a penalty decision overturned just before halftime after the referee first pointed to the spot and then was asked to review a coming together of Ramsdale and Leicester forward Jamie Vardy in the box.
On a hot day when the mercury hit around 33 C (91 F), six goals and the pace of the game took a lot out of the players and water breaks were needed in each half. The result means that Arsenal has won both of its opening league games, with Leicester drawing its first match.
Jesus was the focus of Arsenal’s attack throughout the match, with teammates trying to get him the ball at every opportunity. For his first goal, he took one touch after receiving a pass from Xhaka, set himself and then bent a shot that took a slight deflection to sail in past Ward.
Jesus got a bit of help for his second from Vardy. The Leicester forward flicked the ball backward across the face of goal from a corner, and Jesus headed into an empty net at the back post.
The striker nearly scored a hat trick before halftime when he dominated Leicester defender Jonny Evans with his back to goal, spun around him into the box and fired a low shot saved by Ward. He had multiple chances in the second half as well.
Unlike Arsenal, Leicester has been very quiet in the transfer market. The team only announced its first signing of the transfer window on the eve of Saturday’s match. Alex Smithies, a 32-year-old backup goalkeeper who most recently played for Cardiff, signed with the Foxes on a two-year deal.

Erling Haaland might not hog all of Manchester City’s goals this season, after all.
Ilkay Gundogan, Kevin De Bruyne and Phil Foden were City’s scorers — along with an own-goal — in a 4-0 win over Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday, with Haaland barely getting a sight on goal at Etihad Stadium.
The Norway striker scored both of City’s goals in its opening-weekend 2-0 win at West Ham but was mostly crowded out a week later as Bournemouth sat deep with plenty of men behind the ball in a match that resembled an attack vs defense training exercise.
City’s midfielders reaped the benefits of the extra focus on Haaland.
Gundogan’s goal did involve City’s new star striker, with Haaland holding off his marker with his back to goal and clipping a ball through to the Germany midfielder. Gundogan’s left-footed finish found the bottom corner in the 19th for his 50th goal for City.
De Bruyne scored the pick of the goals, the playmaker cutting inside on a counterattack led by Foden in the 31st, beating a defender and bending his shot with the outside of his right foot into the far corner.
De Bruyne returned the favor for Foden six minutes later, slipping a brilliant pass through the legs of a defender and into the path of his teammate, who took a touch and fired in a deflected shot that beat goalkeeper Mark Travers.
Haaland’s best chance fell in the 73rd when he mishit a first-time shot wide from Jack Grealish’s cut-back. The striker was substituted moments later.
The scoring was completed by Jefferson Lerma, who unwittingly turned a cross from Joao Cancelo into his own net from inside Bournemouth’s six-yard box.
It was a wake-up call for Bournemouth after the promoted team started the season with a surprisingly comfortable 2-0 win over Aston Villa last weekend.
City manager Pep Guardiola again chose to start with Bernardo Silva on the bench. The Portugal midfielder has been linked with a move to Barcelona and didn’t start against West Ham, either.

Nepal’s program to reform its economy, supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is about much more than money. It demonstrates to the rest of the world, including donors and investors, that along with policy advice and technical assistance from the IMF, the country’s economy is stable, and the government is making progress to implement its reform agenda in areas like government revenues and spending, monetary and financial policies, and governance.
Nepal has indeed already made important strides on its economic reform agenda, supported by its arrangement with the IMF, which approved a third tranche worth about $52 million in November 2023. To name a few examples, decisive and data-driven monetary policy by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has helped replenish international reserves and rendered unnecessary the use of import restrictions that reduce tax collection and are costly for businesses. Budget discipline by the Ministry of Finance despite a large revenue shortfall has helped preserve one of Nepal’s major economic strengths: a sustainable debt level.
Looking ahead, Nepal needs to fully unlock the country’s potential. While the economy is on a recovery path, growth at present is below potential and everyone, including the government and private sector, is eager for a stronger pickup. A critical near-term government policy to support growth now is to increase capital spending in a fiscally responsible manner. The donor community is keen to support such spending with concessional lending, but execution rates must improve. The National Planning Commission is producing a public investment strategy, building on plans laid out in the budget and IMF advice, which should help accelerate capital spending.
That said, the government fiscal discipline must also be maintained. Striking this balance means that the government should address a major challenge, low fiscal revenue, as a priority. The government is taking some steps in this direction by preparing a domestic revenue mobilization strategy with support from the IMF. With many tax exemptions already identified, progress is possible, with consistent work to move ahead.
Finally, there are also many risks in the horizon, such as higher commodity prices, global growth slowdown, and natural disasters that could reduce growth. In this context, Nepal should lean on its recent momentum to implement additional reforms that are needed to strengthen economic resilience by building buffers and durably improve economic opportunities.
The financial sector shows perhaps the greatest potential for long-term improvement. Credit-to-GDP went from roughly 50% to nearly 100% over the last decade, which is too fast. International experience has shown that it is not possible for credit to expand so fast based on healthy lending to good projects, and many countries with excessively rapid credit growth wind up with painful credit busts.
Nepal can avoid a sharp correction, but it will need to adjust its lending practices. Fortunately, the NRB has improved its supervisory system for banks and amended regulations on asset classification and working capital loans. These reforms aim at strengthening bank monitoring, stimulating proper loan classification and improving lending practices, thereby supporting a transition to more sustainable and pro-growth credit. We can already see a gradual shift in lending toward term loans, better suited for investments, and away from excessive working capital loans and overdrafts. The upcoming loan portfolio review will complement what has been achieved and help address remaining problems.
Finally, governance is a key pillar of Nepal’s program. Advancing governance reform and moving toward international standards will help showcase Nepal’s improving institutional strength to the global community and help attract international investors. Priorities include amending the NRB Act, enhancing the external audit of the NRB, and addressing current weaknesses in the anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework by the recent passing of the AML/CFT amendment bill and raising effectiveness on the ground.
Nepal is engaging with the world more than ever. The upcoming Investment Summit presents an opportunity to showcase Nepal’s economic potential. In addition to the reforms already mentioned, Nepal will get the most out of the summit and its emerging international stature if it improves swiftly and durably its investment climate, builds human capital, and improves social safety nets. The government is leading the way, with help from the IMF. Nepal is full of tremendous potential, and the IMF is a partner to support the country achieve it.

Nepal’s program to reform its economy, supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), is about much more than money. It demonstrates to the rest of the world, including donors and investors, that along with policy advice and technical assistance from the IMF, the country’s economy is stable, and the government is making progress to implement its reform agenda in areas like government revenues and spending, monetary and financial policies, and governance.
Nepal has indeed already made important strides on its economic reform agenda, supported by its arrangement with the IMF, which approved a third tranche worth about $52 million in November 2023. To name a few examples, decisive and data-driven monetary policy by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has helped replenish international reserves and rendered unnecessary the use of import restrictions that reduce tax collection and are costly for businesses. Budget discipline by the Ministry of Finance despite a large revenue shortfall has helped preserve one of Nepal’s major economic strengths: a sustainable debt level.

Recent social media trends have brought the issue of fire incidents in electric vehicles to the forefront. Particularly as the global shift toward clean energy vehicles gains momentum general population have started to pay attention. It has become somewhat commonplace to come across images or videos of burning electric vehicles on social media platforms, creating concerns.
Especially in regions like ours where fire risk mitigation measures are not as robust, fire hazards are destructive. This situation poses a potential threat, considering the limited availability of burn hospitals in Nepal. Activists are actively advocating for increased attention from the government to establish more burn hospitals across the nation but so far their efforts have generated no benefits. There are cities with international airport but no burn hospitals in the country.
In light of these circumstances, if there is a substantial increase in fire incidents involving electric vehicles, it might prompt the government to reevaluate its EV policy. However, any government decision in this regard should be grounded in factual evidence rather than assumptions. In order to gain a clearer understanding, let's explore the potential causes of fires in both Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles and battery-operated electric vehicles and know for sure if there is any factual basis supporting a higher incidence of fires in battery electric vehicles compared to other vehicles.
Potential Causes of Fire in ICE Vehicles
ICE vehicles can catch fire due to various reasons. Here are some common causes of fires in ICE vehicles:
Fuel System Issues:
Fuel leaks from damaged fuel lines, faulty fuel injectors, or a compromised fuel tank can create a flammable environment, leading to fires.
Electrical System Failures:
Short circuits in the electrical system, often caused by damaged wiring, faulty components, or overheating, can ignite flammable materials in the vehicle.
Engine Compartment Fires:
Overheating of the engine or exhaust components combined with combustible fluids or materials in the engine compartment can contribute to fires.
Oil Leaks:
Leaking oil, especially if it comes into contact with hot engine parts, can lead to fires. This can result from worn gaskets, seals, or other engine components.
Exhaust System Issues:
A malfunctioning or damaged exhaust system can expose flammable materials to high temperatures, potentially causing fires.
Brake System Failures:
Overheating of the brake system, particularly due to malfunctioning components or prolonged heavy braking, can contribute to fires.
Collisions and Accidents:
High-impact collisions or accidents that result in structural damage to the vehicle may expose components to conditions that can lead to fires.
Exposure to External Flames:
External factors such as wildfires which is rampant in dry season in Nepal or exposure to open flames can ignite combustible materials in and around the vehicle.
It is important to note that while the causes listed above highlight potential fire risks in ICE vehicles, manufacturers implement safety features and adhere to stringent standards to minimize these risks. Regular vehicle maintenance, timely repairs, and adherence to safety guidelines contribute to reducing the likelihood of fires
Potential cause of Fire in Battery Electric Vehicles
Fires in electric vehicles can occur due to various factors, although it is important to note that such incidents are relatively rare. Here are some potential causes of fires in electric vehicles:
Battery Overcharging:
Overcharging can lead to thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries, resulting in overheating and potential fire. Modern electric vehicles incorporate advanced Battery Management Systems (BMS) to prevent overcharging.
External Impact or Damage:
Physical damage to the battery pack, whether due to accidents, collisions, or external factors, can compromise the integrity of the battery cells, leading to a risk of fire.
Manufacturing Defects in batteries:
Rare instances of manufacturing defects in battery cells or the overall battery pack can cause internal short circuits, potentially leading to fires. Stringent quality control measures are implemented to minimize these risks.
Improper Charging Infrastructure:
Charging infrastructure that is faulty or not designed to handle electric vehicle charging can pose a risk. Issues such as incorrect wiring or insufficient safety measures may contribute to fires during charging.
Software or Electronic System Malfunction:
Malfunctions in the vehicle's electronic systems or software controlling the battery may lead to abnormal behavior, potentially causing overheating and fire.
Prolonged Exposure to Extreme Conditions:
Continuous exposure to extreme temperatures, whether excessively high or low, can impact the performance and safety of the battery, increasing the risk of fire.
It is important to highlight that manufacturers continuously work to address and mitigate these risks through rigorous testing, improved safety standards, and ongoing advancements in battery technology. There are stringent vehicle homologation laws in place in different countries to minimize this affect. But in Nepal homologation is yet to come into practice. Electric vehicles are generally designed with multiple layers of safety features to minimize the likelihood of fires and ensure the overall safety of both the vehicle and its occupants. We should have some mechanism in place to check if these vehicles are what they claim they are.
In examining the potential causes of fires in both ICE vehicles and EVs, it becomes evident that the key factor influencing fire risks lies in the manufacturing quality rather than the inherent nature of the vehicles. Both ICE vehicles and EVs face common challenges, such as  electrical failures, or external impacts, which can contribute to fire incidents. Manufacturers play a pivotal role in minimizing these risks through rigorous quality control measures, safety features, and adherence to stringent standards.
It is crucial to recognize that blaming fire incidents solely on the electric nature of vehicles exacerbate the situation.  ICE engine vehicle with more than 100 years of history are equally prone to fire incidents as any BEV with only decade of history. So it is easier for people to blame new technology , that is not always the case.  As demonstrated in the comparison, ICE vehicles, with over a century of history, have an equal probability of catching fire if manufacturing standards are compromised. The relatively new introduction of electric vehicles may make them an easier target for scrutiny, but a closer examination reveals that fire risks are not exclusive to one type of vehicle.
The conclusion drawn from this analysis is that the primary determinant of fire risks is the commitment of manufacturers to improve  quality control and safety standards. If manufacturers uphold stringent protocols, whether for ICE or electric vehicles, the likelihood of fires is significantly reduced. In essence, it is not the power source but the diligence and precision in the manufacturing process that dictate the safety of a vehicle. As the automotive industry continues to evolve, it is essential to approach discussions around fire risks with a nuanced perspective, acknowledging that both types of vehicles can be equally secure when built to the highest standards. But Nepali government can at least introduce strict homologation laws in country in order to stop importing compromised BEV’s from abroad and expose its citizen to vehicle fires  risks.

In an era dominated by technological advancements and the growing demand for sustainable energy solutions, battery technology plays a pivotal role. Among the various types of batteries, lithium-ion batteries (Li-ion) have emerged as the frontrunners, powering a wide array of devices from smartphones to electric vehicles. But there is growing interest among stakeholders in Nepal and other part of the world  on other alternative to this technology.  This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of battery technology, with a specific focus on the evolution of lithium-ion batteries and potential alternatives that could shape the future of energy storage.
The Rise of Lithium-Ion Batteries:
Lithium-ion batteries have become synonymous with portable electronic devices due to their high energy density, longer lifespan, and lighter weight compared to traditional nickel-based batteries. The journey of Li-ion batteries began in the 1970s, but it wasn't until the 1990s that commercial applications started emerging. The development of these batteries owes much to pioneers like John B. Goodenough, Stanley Whittingham, and Akira Yoshino, who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2019 for their contributions to the development of lithium-ion batteries.
Key Components of Lithium-Ion Batteries     
Positive Electrode (Cathode):
Positive electrode, or cathode is one of the essential players in the battery. It's like the ""giver"" of positive energy. This part is often made from materials such as lithium cobalt oxide, lithium manganese oxide, or lithium iron phosphate.
Negative Electrode (Anode):
On the other side, we have the negative electrode, or anode. Think of it as the ""receiver"" of energy. The anode is usually made of a material called graphite, which is a form of carbon.
Electrolyte:
Picture electrolyte as the facilitator, the mediator that allows things to flow smoothly. It's essentially a mixture of a type of salt containing lithium dissolved in a liquid, which acts as a sort of middleman. This electrolyte enables the movement of lithium ions back and forth between the cathode and anode whenever the battery is being charged or discharged.
So, in simpler terms, when you charge your device, the lithium ions move from the positive side (cathode) to the negative side (anode), storing energy. When you use your device, these ions travel back from the negative side to the positive side, releasing the stored energy to power your gadgets.
Evolution and Innovation
In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in improving the performance of lithium-ion batteries through technological innovations. These breakthroughs have resulted in the widespread adoption of lithium-ion batteries, becoming the most prevalent choice for various applications, notably in electric vehicles household electronics and renewable energy storage systems. In Nepal, lithium-ion batteries are go to choice for all EV’s and high precision energy storage use.

Limited Raw Materials
One prominent issue is the restricted availability of raw materials vital to their production. Elements like lithium, cobalt, and nickel face constraints due to geopolitical factors, increasing demand, and extraction complexities, posing potential threats to the long-term sustainability of lithium-ion battery technology.
Safety Concerns
Safety concerns constitute another significant challenge, particularly in relation to overheating and fire risks. Although such incidents are relatively infrequent, addressing and mitigating these risks is imperative, especially in applications like electric vehicles where large battery packs are utilized.
Environmental Concern
Environmental considerations also loom large, notably concerning battery disposal. Lithium-ion batteries contain hazardous materials, and improper disposal practices can lead to soil and water contamination.
Future alternative to lithium ion batteries
Sodium Ion Batteries
Sodium-ion batteries, a promising alternative to lithium-ion counterparts, operate by substituting lithium ions with sodium as charge carriers. This single modification holds significant implications for battery production, given sodium's abundant availability compared to lithium. Notably, sodium extraction can be accomplished using salt from oceans, making it a widely accessible resource worldwide. The shift to sodium could potentially reduce the overall cost of battery manufacturing, eliminating concerns related to the storage and transportation of lithium, a potentially hazardous material. Despite these advantages, it's crucial to note that sodium-ion battery technology is in its early developmental stages, and widespread integration into daily life is anticipated to take some time.
Nevertheless, sodium-ion batteries come with their own set of drawbacks. The ions they utilize are larger in size compared to lithium, leading to a reduction in energy density. In practical terms, this could mean diminished electric vehicle ranges and shorter runtimes for smartphones when compared to lithium-ion alternatives. Despite these limitations, the positive aspects of sodium-ion batteries, such as their abundant raw material source, warrant ongoing research and exploration of the technology for potential improvements in performance and applicability.
Lithium Sulphur Batteries
The use of cobalt in the anode of lithium-ion batteries poses challenges due to its difficult sourcing. One potential solution to this issue lies in lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries, which employ sulfur as the cathodic material instead of cobalt. Beyond addressing the sourcing difficulties associated with cobalt, Li-S batteries offer notable advantages, including higher energy density and lower production costs, making them an appealing alternative.
However, a significant hurdle for lithium-sulfur batteries lies in their current fast degradation rate. Despite witnessing the application of Li-S batteries in a solar-powered plane as early as 2008, their widespread integration into everyday electronics awaits continued research efforts.
Solid State Batteries
Solid-state batteries utilize a solid electrolyte instead of the liquid electrolyte found in traditional lithium-ion batteries. This design offers several potential advantages, including enhanced safety, higher energy density, and faster charging capabilities. Solid-state batteries have the potential to overcome the safety concerns associated with liquid electrolytes, as they are less prone to issues like overheating and fires. Additionally, the use of solid electrolytes can contribute to longer battery life and increased energy storage capacity, making them a promising candidate for next-generation energy storage solutions.
However, solid-state batteries also face certain drawbacks that need to be addressed for widespread adoption. One significant challenge is the complexity and cost of manufacturing solid-state batteries, which currently makes them more expensive to produce than conventional lithium-ion batteries. Additionally, ensuring the stability and longevity of solid-state battery technology over numerous charge-discharge cycles is an ongoing concern.
In conclusion, despite the drawbacks associated with lithium-ion batteries, their extensive use is unlikely to wane anytime soon. The practicality of transitioning away from lithium-ion technology is less likely especially  in  countries like Nepal, where the adoption of emerging battery technologies is likely to take years. As advancements continue and research progresses, the energy storage landscape may witness transformative changes, but for now, the reliability and familiarity of lithium-ion batteries will likely maintain their dominance in the foreseeable future.

In the pursuit of sustainable transportation, the global automotive landscape is witnessing a profound transformation. The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) presents an opportunity for countries like Nepal to make environmentally conscious choices. As the transition toward sustainable transportation gains momentum in Nepal, the interest in electric vehicles (EVs) is significant. However, there is a growing curiosity about hydrogen cars and how they differ from electric cars. Let's delve into the working technological difference between hydrogen cars and electric cars, and why it is necessary for country like ours to shift focus from electric vehicle to hydrogen powered cars.
Technology Difference between Electric Vehicle and Hydrogen Vehicle
Hydrogen cars and electric cars differ primarily in their energy storage and conversion technologies. Here's a breakdown of the key technology differences between hydrogen cars and electric cars:
Energy Storage:
Hydrogen Cars: Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles use a fuel cell to convert hydrogen gas into electricity. The hydrogen is stored in high-pressure tanks on board the vehicle. The fuel cell then combines hydrogen with oxygen from the air to produce electricity, water, and heat.
Electric Cars: Electric vehicles are powered by batteries, usually lithium-ion batteries. These batteries store electrical energy and release it to power an electric motor, which drives the wheels of the vehicle.
Energy Conversion:
Hydrogen Cars: Hydrogen fuel cells directly convert chemical energy from hydrogen into electricity through an electrochemical reaction. The overall process involves fewer conversion steps compared to the indirect method of electricity generation and storage in batteries.
Electric Cars: Batteries store electrical energy, and the electric motor converts this stored electricity back into mechanical energy to drive the vehicle. This involves two energy conversion steps: charging the battery and discharging it to power the motor.
Charging/Refueling Infrastructure:
Hydrogen Cars: Hydrogen cars refuel at specialized hydrogen refueling stations. These stations compress and dispense hydrogen gas, and the refueling process is similar to that of traditional gasoline vehicles.
Electric Cars: Electric vehicles charge using electrical outlets, which can range from standard household outlets to specialized charging stations. Charging times and speeds can vary based on the charging infrastructure and the vehicle's charging capacity.
Range and Refueling Time:
Hydrogen Cars: Hydrogen cars often boast longer ranges on a single refueling compared to many electric cars on a single charge. Additionally, refueling a hydrogen car takes only a few minutes, similar to the time it takes to refuel a traditional gasoline car.
Electric Cars: While electric vehicles have varying ranges, they generally have shorter ranges than hydrogen cars. Charging times for electric cars can vary, with standard charging taking longer than faster charging options.
Weight and Space Considerations:
Hydrogen Cars: Hydrogen fuel cells and high-pressure storage tanks can be heavy, affecting the overall weight and space utilization within the vehicle. This can impact factors like handling and cargo space.
Electric Cars: Batteries contribute significantly to the weight of electric vehicles, but advancements in battery technology are continually improving energy density, reducing weight, and optimizing space usage.
Efficiency:

Nepal, with its breathtaking landscapes and cultural richness, is facing the harsh impacts of climate change. While global leaders engage in discussions at fancy conferences in COP28 Nepal is standing at the forefront of the battle against climate change. The tripartite approach involving local, provincial, and federal governments is crucial for implementing and enforcing comprehensive policies, with a specific focus on promoting Electric Vehicles (EVs) to foster clean mobility and energy.
Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is participating in COP28. Despite securing various commitments for funding, the effectiveness of these financial resources hinges on the imperative task of reforming clean energy and electric vehicle policies within Nepal. Simply obtaining funds may prove futile unless our nation addresses and rectifies its internal governance frameworks. In this context, the key lies not just in obtaining green funds, but in devising and implementing robust policies. A pivotal element in this process is the adoption of a tripartite approach involving local, provincial, and federal governments. This collaborative effort is essential for the successful implementation and enforcement of comprehensive policies, particularly those geared toward advancing the cause of clean mobility and energy, with a specific emphasis on promoting Electric Vehicles (EVs).
Local-level initiatives
Local governments serve as the vanguard in the fight against climate change. Initiatives at this level can create a domino effect, inspiring communities to embrace sustainable practices. The promotion of Electric Vehicles (EVs) can commence with practical incentives and tax cuts. For example, offering free and priority parking for EVs in metropolitan areas can significantly boost their adoption.
Moreover, local governments can actively be involved in the development of charging infrastructure, strategically placing charging stations in key locations such as shopping districts and transportation hubs. This proactive approach not only facilitates the practical needs of EV owners but also sends a strong signal about the commitment to sustainable transportation.
Designating iconic places such as Kathmandu Durbar Square, Thamel, and Durbar Marg as EV-only zones is a bold move that not only showcases a commitment to sustainable transportation but also sets a precedent for other regions. These zones not only encourage EV usage but also contribute to the reduction of air pollution in historically significant areas.
Additionally, providing tax breaks to businesses incorporating EVs into their operations not only supports cleaner mobility but also stimulates a positive shift in the business community toward eco-friendly practices. Conducting a robust public awareness campaign is another essential initiative, educating residents about the benefits of EVs and dispelling myths surrounding them. This proactive outreach helps create a well-informed community, fostering a positive attitude toward EV adoption.
Furthermore, implementing training programs for local mechanics and technicians ensures that the workforce is equipped with the skills needed to service and maintain electric vehicles. This initiative not only supports the growing EV market but also creates job opportunities and expertise within the community.
These comprehensive local-level initiatives not only contribute to a reduction in carbon footprints but also create tangible examples of a community actively working toward sustainable development. By combining practical incentives, infrastructure development, awareness campaigns, and training programs, local governments can spearhead a transformative shift toward a more sustainable and environmentally conscious urban landscape.
Provincial push for change
Provincial governments play a crucial role in amplifying the impact of EV-friendly policies. By providing tax breaks on yearly taxes for individuals adopting EVs, provinces can incentivize green choices. Moreover, retrofitting policies need to be customized for each state, considering the diverse needs and challenges faced by different regions. For instance, Madhesh province may require distinct policies compared to Karnali due to differing geographical and climatic conditions.
To attract investors to the EV industry, provinces can engage in healthy competition. Offering incentives such as free land, tax breaks on state taxes, facilitation of access to electricity, and other necessary resources can entice investors to establish EV assembly plants. Implementing subsidies and incentives for EV users not only accelerates the adoption of green technologies but also provides an economic boost to local communities.
This provincial push ensures that the benefits of EV adoption are felt at a grassroots level, contributing to regional development and creating a ripple effect that resonates across the nation.
Competition for sustainable development
One of the significant advantages of a tripartite approach is the healthy competition it fosters among provinces. Each province can strive to provide the best incentives and infrastructure to attract investors in the EV industry. This competition can lead to innovation and efficiency in policy implementation.
Provinces can vie with each other to offer the most attractive package, including free land, tax breaks on provincial taxes, and efficient facilitation of essential resources. The goal should be to create an environment where investors see the potential for growth and sustainability in each province.
Moreover, this competition can extend to the implementation of EV-friendly policies, such as subsidies and incentives for users. By doing so, provinces not only contribute to the national effort to combat climate change but also establish themselves as leaders in sustainable development.
Federal facilitation for sustainable change
At the federal level, the government holds the key to shaping policies that govern import duties on Electric Vehicles (EVs). By strategically implementing import duty laws, the federal government can make EVs more affordable, encouraging a broader segment of the population to embrace cleaner transportation. This move can significantly impact the accessibility of EVs, making them a viable option for a larger demography.
In conjunction with import duty reforms, a robust homologation policy is essential. Establishing clear and favorable homologation standards for electric vehicles ensures that imported EV models comply with safety and environmental regulations. A well-crafted homologation policy not only guarantees the quality and suitability of EVs for the local market but also streamlines the importation process, reducing barriers to entry for manufacturers.
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policies also need to align with the vision of a sustainable future. The federal government can play a pivotal role in attracting FDI in the EV industry, fostering economic growth and technological advancements. By offering incentives and a supportive regulatory environment, the government can encourage both domestic and international companies to invest in the development, manufacturing, and distribution of electric vehicles.
Furthermore, reforming tax laws to promote public vehicles over private ones can be a game-changer. Incentivizing the adoption of electric public transportation, such as buses and taxis, through tax breaks or subsidies, underscores the importance of collective responsibility in the fight against climate change. This approach not only accelerates the transition to greener transportation options but also contributes to a significant reduction in overall emissions.
Conclusion
Nepal stands at a pivotal juncture in its fight against climate change. A tripartite approach involving local, provincial, and federal governments is essential for success. From providing incentives at the local level to tailoring retrofitting policies at the provincial level and shaping import duty laws at the federal level, each tier of government has a unique role to play. The competition among provinces to attract investors and promote sustainable practices can further accelerate the transition to clean mobility and energy.
In the face of global climate challenges, Nepal has the opportunity to become a beacon of change, showcasing how a united effort at all levels of government can drive the transformation toward a sustainable and eco-friendly future.

A recent announcement by the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) regarding its intention to issue an Initial Public Offering (IPO) to raise approximately Rs 60 billion has garnered positive public attention. However, this opinion piece advocates for an alternative approach: asset monetization. It will highlight the benefits of asset monetization and underline the potential pitfalls associated with an IPO, especially in the envisioned regulatory landscape of power market.
Challenges with IPO:
NEA holds a near-monopoly in electricity sector and operates as a regulated entity. The Electricity Regulatory Commission (ERC) determines retail electricity tariffs duly considering the public interest objectives associated with the electricity supply. This regulatory setting restricts NEA's Return on Equity (RoE) or Return on Assets (RoA) to levels typically lower than those of listed companies. Thus, IPO investors might struggle to achieve expected return unless NEA generates significant profits from power exports and dividends from its subsidiaries.
Second, so far it is unclear whether NEA intends to utilize the IPO proceeds to finance new projects or reduce its debt. In the latter case, both IPO investors and NEA management should weigh the cost of borrowing – typically lower for a state-owned utility – against the cost of equity. Unless these two costs align, proceeds should fund new projects. Even then, from an IPO investor’s perspective, financing new generation projects is attractive in terms of return compared to the investment into transmission and distribution projects. Profitability inherent to the IPO investment is thus unclear unless the use of proceeds is explicitly stated.
Third, NEA is a vertically integrated monopoly engaged in generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity. However, the power market's future design envisions the separation of these functions into distinct entities. Hydropower Development Policy (2001), Corporate Development Plan of NEA (2019-2024) and the new electricity bill under consideration have envisaged the unbundling of NEA’s operations. Therefore, the future unbundling process through which NEA shall pass constitutes regulatory risks for IPO investors.
Finally, the news so far floated in public revealed a rough figure of almost Rs 60 billion to be collected from the domestic capital market. Substantial magnitude of this proceeds is likely to offset the fund availability for the generation projects of private developers. One-shot collection from such issue during times when government is heavily mobilizing internal borrowing to fund fiscal deficit may cause resource scarcity for the private sector power generation projects and other sectors of the economy.
Why asset monetization is a better option?
Asset monetization refers to the process of converting an asset into cash or liquid form of value. Asset monetization, a strategy to leverage private sector capital and efficiency, presents an appealing alternative to an IPO. In infrastructure sector, the public sector agency could leverage capital from the brownfield assets like roads, power plants, transmission lines, etc. to finance the creation of similar or other greenfield assets. There are altogether 14 hydropower plants (having installed capacity greater than 5MW) in operation with a total installed capacity of 564 MW under full ownership of NEA. Given the availability of tariff determination methodology, operational power plants except storage projects, are the most viable and first assets to begin the monetization. Monetization is therefore not only an alternative to IPO but also eliminates the challenges pertinent to the IPO.
First, the monetization of generation assets empowers NEA to explore a range of strategies, including Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InVITs), Tariff (PPA)-Operate-Transfer, Structured Bonds, and more. Given the increasing depth of international financial market and diversity of investor’s risk-appetite, these schemes, tailorable to different risk-appetites, can attract a diverse range of international investors. This infusion of foreign capital, as opposed to relying solely on an IPO, alleviates the pressure on the domestic capital pool, thereby bolstering the availability of funds for private developers' power generation projects as well as for other sectors of the economy.
Second, the brownfield generation assets owned by NEA entail significantly lower risk in comparison to greenfield projects. This reduced level of risk incentivizes investors to accept lower returns, thereby aligning with the public interest goal of minimizing electricity tariffs. Additionally, the incorporation of take-or-pay provision in power purchase agreements ensures a steady revenue stream and bolsters the valuation of the project. As a result, a corresponding cohort of investors with an appetite for a given risk-return profile will participate in the bidding and investment processes. Consequently, the dual public interest objectives, one aimed at reducing tariffs and the other at increasing project valuation, are achievable through monetization.
Third, monetizing generation assets could mark a pivotal move in the direction of achieving the objective of unbundling NEA's operations, effectively disentangling generation from transmission and distribution. The funds generated through this monetization process can be allocated to the expansion and reinforcement of transmission and distribution networks. Equally important is its potential to enable NEA to focus entirely on improving network efficiency by adopting cost-effective technologies, thereby reducing the overall operational costs.
Finally, in the context of asset monetization, NEA's capital structure remains unaltered by the proceeds generated. Maintaining a consistent debt level, the average cost of capital for NEA remains steady. Conversely, in the event of an IPO issuance, the weighted average cost of capital increases as the share capital expands, encompassing the addition of public shares. Ultimately, through monetization strategies, NEA can invest in transmission and distribution projects without overburdening its balance sheet with excessive share capital.
In conclusion, given the potential challenges associated with an IPO, exploring asset monetization under suitable schemes appears to be a more desirable route for NEA. To make this a reality, the regulations that permit the operationalization of such schemes must be formulated and put in place. A closer reference of these schemes could be taken from the recent monetization experiences in India where various public assets have been monetized under different schemes.

On one fine Saturday morning in my early childhood days, my parents chose to embark on a delightful journey with me to the cultural gem that is Bhaktapur Durbar Square. The day held unparalleled excitement, not merely for the prospect of delving into Bhaktapur's rich history and culture, but also for the anticipated adventure of riding a trolley bus. In days of yore, these splendid vehicles gracefully traversed the route between Kathmandu and Bhaktapur. The indelible memory of our trolley bus journey, weaving through the lush paddy fields of Bhaktapur, remains vivid in my recollections. Inaugurated with foresight in 1975, the trolley bus system epitomized visionary utilization of Nepal's hydroelectric potential. Given the contemporary challenges of climate change and environmental stewardship, resurrecting this historic mode of transport presents an opportunity for a sustainable and cost-effective solution to meet the modern transportation needs of Nepal. The potential to reintegrate the trolley bus into the public transportation strategy is a beckoning prospect, offering Nepal the chance to inscribe a new chapter in its transportation history.
One of the primary technical advantages of trolley buses over battery-operated electric counterparts lies in their battery-less design. This not only yields a substantial reduction in the overall cost of the buses but also mitigates the need for importing expensive battery technology from international markets. The elimination of battery dependence offers a dual benefit to Nepal: significant fiscal savings and a positive environmental impact. The intricate process of battery disposal, replete with environmental complexities, underscores the inherent sustainability of trolley buses. For individuals and entities considering a transition to electric mobility, the issue of battery replacement emerges as a formidable technical challenge. In this technical landscape, the trolley bus stands out as a prudent and environmentally sound solution, providing a technically superior alternative for those navigating the intricate terrain of sustainable transportation.
Furthermore, Nepal's significant hydroelectric potential positions it favorably for a trolley bus revival. Trolley buses draw power directly from overhead wires, eliminating the need for batteries. Given Nepal's wealth of hydroelectric resources, this approach aligns seamlessly with the country's commitment to clean energy. The government, in collaboration with the Nepal Electricity Authority and the private sector, can invest in building power lines above roads and highways to create a comprehensive trolley bus network. This can create a huge demand of electricity inside our own country and replace environmentally toxic fossil fuels to run our vehicles.
Moreover, investing in the trolley bus system and its infrastructure presents a unique opportunity for Nepal's economy. With most resources already available within the country, this investment minimizes the outflow of money. The construction and maintenance of power lines and trolley bus infrastructure will create jobs, providing a boost to the local economy. Additionally, the increased demand for energy, driven by the trolley bus system, can enhance energy sales and contribute to economic growth.
Cities like Kathmandu, characterized by their smaller size compared to global metropolises, can capitalize on the advantages of a trolley bus system. The cost-effective construction of a trolley bus network in a smaller area, such as a 30 km line around the ring road, could serve as a model for sustainable urban transportation. This focused approach not only saves money but also addresses environmental concerns within a specific geographic area.
Advantages of Trolley Buses over Battery-Operated Electric Buses:
Continuous Power Supply: Trolleybuses have a continuous and reliable power supply as long as they are connected to the overhead wires. In contrast, battery-operated electric buses rely on batteries, which have limited capacity and need to be recharged periodically. Trolleybuses can operate without interruptions as long as they remain connected to the power source.
Reduced Battery Weight: Battery-operated electric buses require large and heavy batteries to store sufficient energy for extended operation. This added weight can impact the overall efficiency and performance of the bus. Trolleybuses do not carry heavy batteries, leading to potentially better energy efficiency and reduced weight, which can positively affect factors such as braking and overall handling.
Extended Range: Trolleybuses are not limited by the range constraints associated with batteries. As long as there is an overhead wire network, trolleybuses can operate continuously without the need for recharging. Battery-operated electric buses, on the other hand, need to stop and recharge, which can limit their range and operational efficiency.
Lower Maintenance Costs: Trolleybuses generally have simpler propulsion systems compared to battery-electric buses. The absence of a complex battery system and the associated maintenance requirements can contribute to lower maintenance costs for trolleybuses.
Lower Initial Costs: The infrastructure required for trolleybuses, such as overhead wires and power supply systems, may be less expensive to implement than building a widespread charging infrastructure for battery-operated buses. This could result in lower initial costs for implementing a trolleybus system in a city.
Energy Efficiency: Trolleybuses can be more energy-efficient compared to battery-operated buses, especially in situations where the power comes from a relatively clean and efficient source. Transmitting power directly from the grid to the bus can be more efficient than charging and discharging batteries, which incurs energy losses.
Conclusion
The strategic investment in a trolley bus system for Nepal embodies a technologically advanced, economically sound, and environmentally sustainable paradigm for public transportation. Drawing from historical antecedents, this initiative provides the government with a unique opportunity to engineer a state-of-the-art, efficient, and environmentally friendly transportation infrastructure.

Nepal stands at a crossroads in the global transition to electric vehicles (EVs). The world is increasingly moving toward sustainable transportation, and Nepal, with its breathtaking landscapes, ecological sensitivity, and abundant renewable energy resources, should have been at the forefront of the EV revolution. However, despite the global trend, the country faces substantial challenges in fully embracing this transformative technology. A key reason behind Nepal's hesitation to adopt EVs is the absence of effective homologation processes. In this article, we will explore the concept of homologation, its critical importance, and how its absence is significantly impacting the electric vehicle industry in Nepal.
Homologation is a certification process that assures a product, such as a vehicle, conforms to specific technical and safety standards mandated by a government or regulatory authority. It's a seal of approval that certifies a vehicle's fitness for operation in a particular country or region. These standards encompass a wide array of criteria, including emissions control, safety features, vehicle performance, and various other technical specifications.
Homologation stands as the linchpin for ensuring the safety and reliability of electric vehicles, especially in a country like Nepal, where the road infrastructure is often challenging and diverse. To protect passengers and extend the lifespan of EVs on these demanding terrains, adhering to specific safety and performance standards becomes a matter of paramount importance. By subjecting vehicles to rigorous homologation standards, it becomes possible to prevent the importation of substandard or unsafe EVs, thereby shielding consumers from potential harm.
Each region has its unique environmental, terrain, and cultural factors that can significantly impact the suitability of electric vehicles. Homologation, therefore, plays a crucial role in enabling the customization of EVs to cater to the specific requirements of Nepal. For example, EVs can be optimized to navigate the country's hilly terrains and monsoon conditions, delivering improved performance and a longer lifespan. This tailored approach ensures that EVs in Nepal are not just vehicles but solutions uniquely adapted to the local context. The same EV that is working great in a plain terrain in India might not be suitable in our hilly bumpy roads. Nepal needs vehicles that are made for its terrain and environment.
Certified vehicles, those that have successfully undergone homologation, instill confidence in consumers. When Nepali buyers have the assurance that the EVs they purchase adhere to certain well-defined standards, it significantly boosts the overall acceptance of electric vehicles, thus propelling the EV revolution in the country.
The lack of effective homologation processes in Nepal has given rise to numerous critical issues for the electric vehicle industry in the country. One of the most significant challenges Nepal faces is the importation of EVs that do not align with the country's specific requirements. Importers frequently introduce two-wheelers and other four-wheeler vehicles that may not be equipped to handle Nepal's demanding terrains and climate conditions. There are probably more than 100 two-wheeler EV brands running in the streets of Kathmandu. Most of those are not suitable to run in our terrain and environment. Consequently, consumers find themselves with EVs that are ill-suited for their daily needs, leading to frustration and a growing sense of distrust toward electric vehicle technology.
Furthermore, Nepal's regulatory authorities have yet to conduct thorough research and analysis on electric vehicles. This knowledge gap results in a market flooded with an array of EVs, about which little is known concerning their performance under local conditions. The lack of homologation standards means that importers often lack the capacity to provide accurate information about motor capacity, battery life, and overall vehicle performance.
The absence of homologation has led to a chaotic environment in Nepal's electric vehicle market. With a multitude of models available and minimal regulatory oversight, consumers face difficulty when trying to make informed decisions about which EV to purchase. The lack of standardized information exacerbates the problem, making it challenging for consumers to navigate the market effectively.
The absence of effective homologation standards places immense pressure on local electric vehicle businesses. Many of these enterprises, initiated with great enthusiasm, have encountered difficulties in maintaining viability due to fierce competition from imports and consumer dissatisfaction. The lack of government intervention threatens the domestic electric vehicle industry with further setbacks, potentially leading to economic losses.
To revitalize Nepal's electric vehicle market and position the country as a regional leader in sustainable transportation, the government must take decisive actions. Nepal urgently requires the implementation of homologation standards for electric vehicles. These standards should include safety regulations, performance benchmarks, and local adaptability requirements. This will ensure that only high-quality, suitable EVs are imported and sold within the country.
The establishment of a dedicated regulatory authority for electric vehicles is essential for overseeing and enforcing homologation standards. This body should work in tandem with industry experts to ensure that regulations remain up-to-date and relevant to Nepal's unique conditions. To stimulate the growth of local electric vehicle manufacturers, the government should offer incentives and support. Initiatives could include research and development grants, low-interest loans, and favorable tax policies. Promoting local production can lead to job creation, economic growth, and a thriving electric vehicle industry.
The government and industry stakeholders should invest in public awareness campaigns. Educating consumers about the benefits of electric vehicles and the importance of purchasing certified, locally-adapted models can bolster confidence and demand for EVs, further propelling the electric vehicle revolution.
The absence of effective homologation standards is impeding Nepal's transition to electric vehicles. The importation of unsuitable EVs has led to consumer dissatisfaction and market confusion. In the short history of EV in Nepal, there are already some companies going out of business and shutting down their operations. This will only send negative message to general public. This could have been stopped had our government acted smartly in the first place. The government's immediate action is required to implement homologation standards, support local businesses, and educate consumers to propel the growth of the electric vehicle industry in Nepal. By doing so, Nepal can seize the opportunity to lead the electric vehicle revolution, capitalizing on the environmental and economic benefits it offers. Failure to act promptly could result in enduring setbacks and a missed opportunity to become a sustainable transport leader in the region. The time to act is now.

Prime Minister (PM) Pushpa Kamal Dahal's intriguing aspiration to experience a hydrogen-powered car really caught my attention. It made me question the legitimacy of his remarks. Did he really mean it or just said it to boost his popularity? It also shed some light on how unbeknown Nepali population is in regards to hydrogen. Even though hydrogen has a storied history as an energy source dating back to 1804, Nepal has seldom used it. So, it is common for most Nepali to view hydrogen as new source of energy. So let me shed dome light on how hydrogen is produced, what are its application, how population around the world are using hydrogen as a source of energy and how we as a nation can capitalize on its potential.
There are numerous ways of producing hydrogen. The most common process to produce hydrogen is through a process called steam methane reforming (SMR), which involves the reaction of natural gas with steam to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide (CO2). The CO2 produced is typically released into the atmosphere, making this process environmentally unfriendly. The hydrogen produced in this process are called gray or blue hydrogen.
The other process of producing hydrogen is through a process called electrolysis, where water is split into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity, typically sourced from renewable energy sources like wind, solar, or hydropower. Hydrogen produced through this process is considered the cleanest form of hydrogen because it produces no carbon emissions during its production. This way of production of hydrogen is what we are focusing on in Nepal. There are other emerging methods of hydrogen production, such as thermolysis, biomass gasification, and high-temperature electrolysis. These technologies are still in the development and experimental stages but hold promise for clean hydrogen production. To put this in perspective, around 47% of the global hydrogen production is from natural gas, 27% from coal, 22% from oil (as a by-product) and only around 4% comes from electrolysis.
The largest producer of hydrogen in the world can vary depending on the type of hydrogen produced. Historically, the United States and China have been the largest producers of hydrogen overall, mainly gray hydrogen. However, as the world shifts toward cleaner energy sources, countries with strong commitments to green hydrogen, like Germany and Norway, are becoming significant players in the hydrogen market.
Hydrogen has many applications. Traditionally hydrogen has been used for years in production of ammonia, oil refining, and the manufacturing of semiconductors. Due to increase in demand for clean energy production where green hydrogen can be used, nowadays hydrogen is also used in transportation, energy storage, and power generation. Efforts are also underway to use hydrogen for residential cooking and heating. As the world seeks to reduce carbon emissions and embrace cleaner energy solutions, hydrogen continues to play an increasingly critical role in various sectors, with ongoing research and development promising further diversification of its applications in the future.
Nepal stands at the brink of an exciting and transformative journey in the realm of energy production and utilization. The country boasts a significant advantage: it possesses abundant hydroelectric potential, while concurrently lacking reserves of coal, oil, or natural gas. This unique energy landscape makes Nepal exceptionally well-suited for development of clean hydrogen production.
Hydroelectricity is Nepal's forte, and it constitutes a primary source of power generation in the nation. However, the intermittent nature of hydroelectric energy production has presented challenges. Nepal's hydroelectricity primarily relies on the flow of water, leading to a fluctuating supply of electricity. During periods of elevated water levels, energy production surges, but it dwindles when water levels recede. Consequently, a considerable portion of generated energy often goes to waste. Moreover, during the nighttime, when energy demand is considerably lower, an excess of energy remains underutilized.
In light of these challenges, green hydrogen production emerges as a promising solution to harness the untapped potential of Nepal's renewable energy resources. By utilizing surplus electricity during periods of abundance and in off-peak hours, green hydrogen production presents a means to capture and store this excess energy efficiently. Green hydrogen can subsequently be employed in a diverse range of applications, including transportation, industrial processes, and energy storage, thus maximizing the utility of Nepal's hydroelectric capacity and promoting sustainability within the nation's energy sector. The convergence of abundant hydroelectricity and the potential for green hydrogen production positions Nepal at the forefront of the global clean energy transition.
To catalyze a successful transition toward hydrogen-based energy utilization, Nepal's focus should predominantly shift toward the development of hydrogen production, packaging, and transportation infrastructure, rather than primarily investing in research of its direct applications in cooking , heating and other purpose. Redirecting resources toward infrastructure development is imperative, as it lays the essential foundation for harnessing the nation's existing hydroelectric potential for green hydrogen production. The current allocation of funds by scholars and researchers into the application of hydrogen for cooking and heating, while important, may be more effective when complemented by a strategic emphasis on infrastructure. This approach ensures that, when applications for hydrogen emerge, Nepal will have the means to self-sufficiently produce, store, and transport hydrogen, reducing dependency on other nations for this valuable energy source.
In order to bring PM Dahal's visionary aspirations to fruition, Nepal should wholeheartedly commit to clean hydrogen production and explore the possibilities of exporting this invaluable resource to neighboring countries, including India. India's current demand for hydrogen, which stands at approximately 6 million tons per annum, offers a promising market that Nepal should promptly leverage. With this immense untapped potential, Nepal can position itself as a significant hydrogen producer. Who knows may be one day our government will be thinking about constructing a gas pipeline from Nepal to India or even Bangladesh for the supply of clean hydrogen instead of constructing pipelines for the import of oil and natural gas. This paradigm shift aligns with a sustainable future, offering energy self-reliance and reducing dependence on foreign energy sources. And by the time our PM will be riding a hydrogen-powered vehicle, he can refuel his vehicle with domestically established hydrogen refueling station rather than using imported gray hydrogen from other countries.

Nepal, a land of diverse landscapes and breathtaking vistas, is not only rich in its natural beauty but also holds immense potential for renewable energy. Historically, the country has been heavily reliant on hydropower, utilizing its numerous rivers to generate electricity. While hydropower has been a reliable source of energy for Nepal for many years, recent global trends in renewable energy adoption, particularly solar energy, have sparked interest in alternative sources of power generation.
In the wake of advancing technologies and growing environmental concerns, countries around the world have been making a decisive shift toward harnessing solar energy. Solar power is an eco-friendly and sustainable alternative that offers numerous benefits. It is abundant, inexhaustible, and emits no harmful greenhouse gases, making it a crucial component in the fight against climate change. Moreover, solar panels have a long operational life, require minimal maintenance, and can be installed on rooftops, making them accessible for distributed energy generation.
One of the key reasons for Nepal's hesitation in capitalizing on its solar potential is its longstanding reliance on hydropower. For decades, hydropower has been the backbone of the country's energy sector, and transitioning to a new energy paradigm may seem daunting. However, with changing global dynamics and the urgent need to diversify the energy mix, the Nepali government and private sector must seize the opportunity to embrace solar energy.
One significant factor driving the shift toward solar is the decreasing cost of photovoltaic (PV) modules. Over the years, advancements in solar technology and manufacturing processes have led to a remarkable reduction in the cost of solar panels. This cost reduction has made solar energy increasingly competitive compared to traditional energy sources. By taking advantage of the falling costs, Nepal can implement large-scale solar projects more economically, fostering rapid growth in the solar energy sector.
Furthermore, solar energy provides a complementary solution to the existing hydropower infrastructure in Nepal. Hydropower tends to generate more electricity during the wet season when rivers are brimming with water. However, during the dry season, when water levels recede, energy production diminishes, leading to energy deficits. By integrating solar energy into the energy mix, Nepal can bridge this seasonal gap, ensuring a more consistent and reliable energy supply throughout the year.
The advantages of solar energy extend beyond its complementarity with hydropower. The cost comparison between hydropower and solar energy speaks volumes about the financial sense of embracing solar. The price of constructing a hydropower project is twice as much as a solar project. Moreover, while a solar project can be completed within a year, a hydropower project in Nepal may take up to two decades to finish. These statistics emphasize the clear advantage solar holds over hydropower, making it an attractive investment prospect.
Moreover, solar energy projects have a smaller environmental footprint compared to large hydropower projects. The construction of extensive dams and reservoirs for hydropower often involves altering the natural landscape and displacing local communities. In contrast, solar installations can be integrated into existing infrastructures or built on marginalized land without significant environmental disruption or social displacement.
Nepal's geographical location in the Himalayan region places it in an advantageous position to harness abundant solar radiation. The country's latitude, altitude, and atmospheric conditions contribute to a favorable solar radiation profile, making it an ideal location for large-scale solar plants. By capitalizing on this natural gift, Nepal can position itself as a leading solar energy producer in the region.
While Nepal's hilly and mountainous terrain may pose some challenges for solar panel placement
due to shading and land use considerations, it can still be advantageous for solar energy
production. The key is careful site selection and engineering to maximize sun exposure and
minimize environmental impact. With the right planning, Nepal can harness its abundant solar
radiation while minimizing adverse effects on its natural landscape, making it a sustainable and
green choice for solar energy production
Another compelling aspect of solar energy is the predictability of energy output. Advanced simulation software allows accurate forecasting of solar energy production based on historical meteorological data. This predictability empowers energy planners and policymakers to make informed decisions, enabling efficient grid management and better resource allocation.
In conclusion, Nepal's vast solar potential remains largely untapped despite the numerous advantages it offers. The decreasing cost of PV modules, complementarity with hydropower, faster project completion times, and minimal environmental impact make solar energy an attractive and viable option for the nation's energy future. By embracing solar energy, Nepal can bolster its energy security, reduce its dependence on costly energy imports during the dry season, and take significant strides toward a greener and more sustainable future. It is time for the Nepal government and private sector to rise to the occasion and harness the power of the sun to propel the nation into a brighter and cleaner energy future.

The World Health Organization (WHO) annually celebrates July 28 as World Hepatitis Day. The date was chosen for World Hepatitis Day in honor of the birthday of Nobel laureate Professor Baruch Samuel Blumberg, who discovered the hepatitis B virus, then known as Australia antigen. In fact the World Hepatitis Alliance first launched World Hepatitis Day in 2008. Under the theme of ""We're Not Waiting"" World Hepatitis Day is being observed throughout the world this year. One life, one liver is also a slogan taken this year. It has become an annual event and provides focus for patient groups and people living with hepatitis, particularly hepatitis B and C, which can cause chronic liver disease, liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. Hepatitis B and C are the silent killer. Many people do not know even if they are infected. So, let’s get checked was one of the theme of earlier Hepatitis Day. The WHO has targeted to eliminate hepatitis by the year 2030, but there is a Herculean task ahead.
World Hepatitis Day is one of only four WHO disease specific days. The other three disease specific days are tuberculosis (March 24), malaria (April 25) and AIDS (December 1).  World Hepatitis Day provides international focus for patient groups and patients living with viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis B and C. The WHO and partners mark World Hepatitis Day to increase the awareness and understanding of viral hepatitis and the diseases caused by hepatitis virus infection.
What is liver?
The liver is the second largest organ beside skin and the largest solid organ in the human body. It is located in the upper right abdomen, beneath the diaphragm and mostly shielded by the lower right rib cage. In an average it weighs about one and half kilogram in an adult and is reddish-brown in color. The liver has many important functions, more than 500 in number. However, following are its important functions.
Detoxification of the blood: Whatever we eat, it goes to the liver via blood after it enters in the intestine. The liver removes toxins from the blood, such as alcohol, drugs, and any other harmful substances that is not native to our body.
Production of bile: Bile is a fluid that helps with digestion. It breaks down fats in food so that they can be absorbed by the body. So, unlike what we general people think, liver do not help in digestion except for the fat.
Energy storage: The liver stores glucose, a type of sugar, in the form of glycogen. When the body needs energy, the liver breaks down glycogen and releases glucose into the bloodstream. If liver is damaged, the sugar control mechanism is hampered.
Production of proteins: The liver produces many proteins that are essential for blood clotting, immune function, and other bodily functions. It is the only organ that produces albumin. Albumin is needed for carrying different substance to different organs of the body. If there is less albumin, we get swollen body, low blood pressure etc.
Clearing waste products: The liver removes waste products from the blood, such as ammonia. In patients with chronic liver disease, there is inability of liver to clear the harmful substances and there are mental changes causing altered sensorium and even coma.
Making hormones and enzymes: The liver produces many hormones and enzymes. It is also responsible for making substances that maintain thinness of the blood and prevent blood clots.
Fighting infection: The liver helps the body fight infection by producing white blood cells. The Kuppfer cells in the liver are mainly responsible for this
The liver is a very resilient organ and can regenerate itself if it is damaged. Most of the people think that a small piece of liver is enough to regenerate and make whole liver. However, if the liver is chronically and severely damaged, it may not be able to recover and may need to be transplanted.
Know about hepatitis virus
Hepatitis viruses are those which have special affinity to the liver and they cause damage to the liver. Viral hepatitis leads to inflammation (damage) of liver cells by those viruses also known as hepatotrophic virus. There are hepatitis A, B, C, D and E that can cause acute and chronic infection. Hepatitis A and E are transmitted by feco-oral route, which means by taking fecal contaminated food and drinks. Both of them cause acute viral hepatitis. Although this disease is often self-limiting, it causes morbidity and work or study loss. However, they can sometimes cause acute liver failure and even death if proper treatment is not instituted. Pregnant women are at risk along with newborn, elderly and people with chronic liver diseases. It is estimated that about 1400,000 new hepatitis A virus infections occur globally each year and underdeveloped country bears the greatest burden. Every year there are 20 million hepatitis E infections, over three million acute cases of hepatitis E, and 70,000 hepatitis E related deaths!
In Nepal, after contracting these hepatitis infection, most of the patients go for alternative medicine due to presence of jaundice. The disease is prolonged due to taking of inappropriate medications and restriction of diet. Many land in the Intensive Care Unit in a state of liver failure. Most of them die in absence of liver transplantation.
Hepatitis B and C cause chronic inflammation of the liver that can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. These viruses constitute a major global health risk. the WHO estimates that there are about 2000 million people, who have been infected with hepatitis B worldwide. More than 290 million are chronically infected and require treatment. Between 500,000 and 700,000 people die every year due to hepatitis B related cirrhosis and liver cancer. At the same time it is estimated that about 71 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus. The potent antiviral medicines have decreased the diseased population to half in the last one decade. More than 350,000 people are estimated to die from HCV-related liver diseases each year worldwide.
How to confront it?
Hepatitis A and E can be prevented by maintaining good personal hygiene. Avoiding unsafe uncooked food and taking processed water can control this disease. Vaccine against hepatitis A is available, while vaccine against hepatitis E is awaiting mass production. More than us, it is the duty of the government to tackle the problem. Because of poor water supply system and inefficient sewerage system, the end of hepatitis A and E is still far from the target elimination.
Viral hepatitis B and C places a heavy burden on the health-care system because of the high costs of treatment of liver cancer and liver failure from cirrhosis. The actual burden of disease related to hepatitis B and C infection is not exactly known in our country. In fact, the problem has not been addressed in a comprehensive way so far by the stakeholders. The researchers and the clinicians are also to be blamed as there are no such researches so far. Because of the fact that the most people do not develop any symptoms when they become infected and that they remain free of symptoms often for decades until they develop chronic liver disease. This has largely resulted in ""the silent epidemic"" that we, the clinicians, are experiencing today. Moreover, most people with chronic infection with hepatitis B or C are unaware that they continue to carry the virus and unknowingly transmit the virus to other people. Hepatitis B vaccination is the best way to deal with this disease. It has been included in EPI schedule and this job is commendable. However, it is still not available in every district. Early detection is paramount as it is curable as well as prevent from developing complications. Those who are at risk should be tested. In our country, there are free medications available for HIV infected patients but there is no such facility for hepatitis patients. The tragedy is that Tenofovir, which is a potent medicine for hepatitis B virus is a part of free ART but not available for hepatitis B patient. Treatment of hepatitis C is very costly. The heartbreaking information is that it is the lone virus waiting for vaccine to be developed. Prevention is better than cure. Intravenous (IV) drug abuse, which constitute >90% of transmission source should be discouraged. Universal precaution should be practiced in health care institute.
Treatment of Hepatitis virus
Hepatitis A and E do not require any treatment. They are self-limiting, and good food, rest and proper diet are essential to get rid of this virus. Once we are infected with hepatitis A virus, there is life-long immunity. It is also rare to get re-infection with hepatitis E virus. It can cause chronic infection in immunocompromised post-transplant patients.
There is medicine for the hepatitis B. But it does not guarantees cure. The infection can be controlled and complications can be prevented. Treatment is very much necessary to prevent transmission to others. Hepatitis C virus can finally be cured with potent antiviral drugs. The success rate is 90-99% if treated appropriately on time. One good thing is that our government is recently providing free treatment for hepatitis C patients who are co-infected with HIV. Hepatitis C can be eliminated from Nepal if the government wants to do it!

President Ram Chandra Paudel authenticated the Citizenship Bill that was passed by the previous parliament.
This has created a strange situation—he has authenticated the bill sent by the parliament whose one part (the then House of Representatives) no longer exists.
A new HoR is in existence after the federal election in November 2022. President Paudel has authenticated the bill that was not passed by the new HoR. This should not have happened.   
We have arrived at this situation due to the mistake committed by then president Bidya Devi Bhandari. Current President Paudel has committed another mistake while correcting that mistake on the request of the Cabinet. He has authenticated the bill arguing that he is constitutionally and morally mandated to comply with the Cabinet’s request.
The government that requested for committing this mistake, therefore, must take responsibility for this. The government had the option of taking a new bill to the current HoR and passing it with majority. But the government chose an easy and illegal path on the pretext that the main opposition CPN-UML would protest and even obstruct House proceedings thereby obstructing passage of the bill. 
Legality of the amended Citizenship Act would be tested if anyone moved the Supreme Court (SC) against the authentication. The apex court can rule on the issues including whether the president is mandated to authenticate a bill passed by the House and whether the president can authenticate a bill that the previous president refused to authenticate. The SC can also speak about whether a bill automatically becomes law if the president refuses to authenticate it as mandated by the Constitution. 
The sad part of this is that the country will now have to suffer unnecessary hassle for some time. The country will now be stuck in the dispute as to whether President Paudel was right to authenticate the bill.
Those who had protested against then president Bhandari’s refusal to authenticate the bill, have moral rights to oppose the step of President Paudel. But those who had argued that Bhandari was right to twice refuse to authenticate the bill  passed by the parliament don’t have the rights to protest against the step of Paudel.
What Bhandari did in capacity of president was not just unconstitutional but even unimaginable. Can she refuse to administer oath of office and secrecy pointing she doesn’t like the prime minister elected by the House or not? Can she refuse to administer oath of office and secrecy pointing she doesn’t like the person picked as chief justice (CJ) or chief of any other constitutional body and endorsed by the House after parliamentary hearing or not? Can she refuse to implement any decision made by the Cabinet pointing she doesn’t like the decision?
The answer is straightforward—she cannot.
But she did so and refused to authenticate the bill that was twice sent to her after being passed by the House. She insisted that she was above the parliament. 
The House should either have impeached her or moved the court seeking legal remedy at that time. Her move should have been resisted from the streets if both of those options were not possible because the president does not have the rights to defy the Constitution. But the parties did not choose to politically resist her unconstitutional step or seek legal remedy as the HoR was already dissolved and the country was facing elections. She got away with the crime.
The Constitution of Nepal does not grant any right to the president to take initiative and work. Our Constitution, in that sense, considers the post of president to be absolutely ceremonial. Let us see what the Constitution has to say about the president. Article 61 says four things about the president.
(1) There shall be a President of Nepal.
(2) The President shall be the Head of State of Nepal. He or she shall perform his or her functions in accordance with this Constitution and federal law.
(3) The President shall promote national unity of Nepal.
(4) The main duty of the President shall be to abide by and protect the Constitution.
The Interim Constitution 2007, which was in effect before the current one was promulgated, had mentioned that ‘the main duty of the President shall be to protect and abide by the Constitution.""
The order of protect and abide by was changed in the current Constitution promulgated in 2015, and abide was written first followed by protect.
The spirit of the current Constitution is clear—the president can protect the Constitution only by abiding by it. The president cannot refuse to abide by the Constitution on the pretext of protecting it. The president not abiding by the Constitution is dereliction of duty.   
Let us be clear, anybody inciting the president to cross the limits of Constitution is inciting for dereliction of duty.
Article 66 further clarifies about the functions, duties and powers of president:
(1) The President shall exercise such powers and perform such duties as conferred on him or her in accordance with this Constitution or the federal law.
(2) In exercising the powers or duties under clause (1), the President shall perform all other functions to be performed by him or her on recommendation and with the consent of the Council of Ministers than those functions specifically provided to be performed on recommendation of any institution or official under this Constitution or federal law. Such recommendation and consent shall be submitted through the Prime Minister.
In this way, the president is clearly bound by the Constitution. The president performs functions on the recommendation of the Cabinet or on the recommendation of some other body or official clearly designated by the Constitution. The Constitution has not given the president the right to take a decision or execute any work regarding the country and government affairs on her own. The Constitution has also not given the president the right to take away the rights granted to others. Therefore, our president is a ceremonial president bound by the Constitution.
Despite such clear provisions regarding the president’s rights and duties, Bidya Devi Bhandari had assaulted the Constitution by not authenticating the bill. And the main opposition party UML had incited her for the assault. Several UML leaders including the chairman had defended the assault. Therefore they now don’t have the moral right to oppose President Paudel’s move.
Others can, however, oppose the president’s move and challenge it in court. The court’s interpretation will provide an outlet to this dispute too, and will set a precedent for the future. It is precedents like this that will continue to further refine and establish the Constitution.
For now, though, there’s a pleasant side to the president’s move: nearly 700,000 people have been deprived of citizenship even though they are children of Nepalis who became citizens by birth through a one-time arrangement after the Janaandolan II in 2006; they will now get citizenship immediately. They will get justice. Their lives will move ahead exercising their rights as Nepali citizens.

The Nepal Academy has recently published photojournalist Bharat Bandhu Thapa's picture book 'Nepal in Pictures'.
The 320-page book includes over 500 photographs depicting tourism, arts, culture and society from Mechi in the east to Mahakli in the west and the height of Mt Everest to the lowlands of Kechanakaval. 
""My objective was to ensure that those who want to know Nepal get to see the main views and know the main specialties of the country in a single book. I was, therefore, working on it for a long time,"" Thapa tells Setopati. ""Nepal is such a big country that it is not possible to include the whole country in 320 pages. But I have tried to include different possibilities of the country as far as I know in this book.""
He added that the book will be polished further in the future. 
The pictures in the books depict places from Olangchung Gola in the east to Kalapani in the Far West, Khaptad, Badimalika, Upper Dolpo, Lumbini, Janaki Temple, Shukaphant to the culture of the Kathmandu Valley. ""Most of the pictures in the book have been clicked by me. But I have not travelled across the whole country. I was undecided about whether to include the places I have not visited or not,"" he reveals. ""I finally decided that those places should not be excluded from the book even if I have not visited.""
He has sought photos of those places from his friends and says that has prevented the book from being incomplete.

Damodar Upadhyaya departed for the heavenly abode last week leaving behind a mass of mourners who have felt his absence like no other times before.
For many, he was known as a political dissident who in 2036 BS ardently fought back the corrupt system propounded by the monarchy of the time, and in the process was subjected into hiding for several years avoiding political arrests.
Much of what he accomplished politically along with his comrade, one of who was CP Mainali, can find its own time and space perhaps at different platforms, but that is not how I will remember him today.
Instead, I want to remember him with a pint of sorrow but with plenty of exuberance.
The day in the summer of 1988 was when fate meandered him to the doors of my 9th grade classroom. He showed up in blue jeans, all pert and basking as our new mathematics teacher. He didn't speak that much unlike many who usually on the first day sing their saga of triumphs. He wasn't them. He was modest, almost didn't seem to care much about what we thought and absolutely was averse to the Dunning Kruger effect unlike most folk who find themselves in that place. (Dunning Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people with limited competence in a particular domain overestimate their abilities)
The man was made of grit and knew the ins and outs of whatever was thrown at him. His cool, calm and even headedness was ‘slay’, as the teenagers these days would have liked to call him.
Years moved along and we were enthralled to learn from him the absurdities of human lives and the aporias it brings along. Mathematics aside, his non-intrusive way of hammering home the arithmetical swagger and his radiating passion for the practicality of logic and treaties on how to trudge along the vicissitudes of life offered his students more than what they ever asked for.
The man was a godsend.
Later on, what would inspire, sustain, and guide many of us along the slog of life’s brazenness came remarkably from just those willed moments that he bequeathed on us.
When I first heard about his passing away, I felt a sting of incompleteness for having such a big part of me taken away.
In silence I reminisced the moment he had asked me to read an essay by Noam Chomsky on ‘manufacturing consent’. To my young impressionable mind this was a watershed moment whence politics and philosophy had found their moorings. For the next 30 years, I would move on, slowly at first but in strides after where I would be at home with myself and not dissipate and wither way in the madness of the day.
Life is better because this man showed me how to live one.
There’s this story of a little boy on an ocean beach, frantically picking up starfish that are getting washed afloat by the colossal waves. The little boy is picking up one starfish at a time and is hurling it back to the water, so it gets a chance to live again.
The boy is relentless and doesn’t cease and goes on for hours trying to save as many as possible.
An old sage walks by and sees this little young man throwing those starfish back into the water.
The sage mulls over for a few minutes and approaches the boy and asks what difference it would make since there are thousands of these starfish beached out.
The little boy looks at the sage, bends down, picks one, gently throws the starfish to the water, and says, “To that one, it makes all the difference!”
Helping one soul at a time. And that is how I will always remember him!
Rest in Peace.

As I look back, I don’t consider myself to be a decent school student. I often avoided homework and put minimal effort into my schoolwork to avoid punishment. Anyone else would have been punished by my school rules for less than that, however, I always got away with it because I did fairly well in my exams. In other words, I was an ‘A’ grade student even though I put in bare minimum effort.  
During my time at school and high school, results were displayed as percentage and not as grades. Now, the education system is on the road of revolution and the grading system has been deployed in school level, high school level and most university level courses. The grading system is believed to be superior to the classical percentage system.
The grading system can alleviate some of the pressure and anxiety associated with the percentage system. In the percentage system, students are often focused on achieving the highest possible scores, as even a slight decrease in percentage can significantly impact their overall performance. In contrast, the grading system allows students to focus on their overall performance in all of the subjects and there is less pressure to score the highest possible points in the exam. This can lead to a healthier learning environment and a more balanced approach to education.
Is the current education system in Nepal fully aligned with the objectives of the grading system? Is relieving pressure from students and making them focus on all possible subjects all the grading system is about? It certainly isn’t.
The news was massive when the percentage system of SLC (now SEE) was changed to GPA system. Many people misunderstood the real meaning of GPA and simply multiplied it by 25 to convert the GPA to percentage. There were numerous articles in the media explaining that GPA cannot be converted to percentage but the other way around is possible. However, merely converting the percentage to GPA is not what the grading system is about. Apart from encouraging students to focus on all the coursework, the grading system has to be more comprehensive rather than just taking into account the outcome of a single exam.
The grading system should take into account multiple factors beyond just exam scores. It should consider various aspects of a student's performance, such as class participation, assignments, projects, and other assessments throughout the academic term. This holistic evaluation provides a more comprehensive view of a student's abilities, strengths, and weaknesses compared to the percentage system, which primarily focuses on exam performance alone. Well, the grading system hasn’t been implemented in this way, just yet. Just over a year ago, the schools were instructed to consider 50% of final grades from exams and 50% from yearly performance evaluated through assignments, project work and group projects. But, I would assume this has rarely been implemented in most schools. While I was a teacher back in Nepal, I tried to abide by this system and tracked the performance of most of the students, noted their progress, encouraged them to participate in the class and gave the grade they deserved after due consideration. But, this required more effort compared to the classic evaluation system.
If a student scored an overall A grade when they graduate in Nepal, what does that mean? It means that they did a good job understanding the course content and did well to put that on the paper. What does it say about the overall attribute of the student? Are they good in class participation? Did they work well to do all the homework assigned to them? Do they work well as a team? Do they have good presentation skills? Were they willing to do any extra work related to the subject? All these questions are probably unanswered.
I want to give an example of two courses that I had to attend for my Master’s Degree, in the USA, during the first semester. I will be talking about how the exams were and how the final grades were calculated.
The first course consisted of four exams and interestingly, for me, the exams were taken from home and we had more than a week to finish it. The questions were open-ended, and one had to go over different articles to answer the questions. The exam demanded effort rather than knowledge that made it superior to classical exams where the capacity of students to remember the content would be tested.
The exams only accounted for 40% of the final grade we received. The rest 60% came from presentations, post presentation discussion, scientific article review, designing info-graphs, weekly assignments and participation.
The second course I took had five exams taken in class. We were allowed to take a page of a help sheet. The help sheet made it sound like the exam would be easy  but it turned out the help sheet would be useless if I had no context of the subject matter. The help sheet would help to fill my answers with specific details because the questions were highly conceptual and needed a story to be built rather than merely asking straightforward questions.
The exam covered 50% for the grade while presentations, peer reviewing and participation consisted of the other 50%.
Upon inquiries with some of my friends who are studying in other universities within the USA, I found the grading system of these two classes represented the grading system of many universities in the USA. Moreover, some professors seem to make the last exam of the course optional, i.e. if you have done pretty well in other exams and have done the required homework, it is not mandatory for you to take the final exam. The final grade accounts for not only efforts in the exam but the work one puts throughout the semester. You could have one or two dreadful exams but you could still end up getting an A if you just show the effort in the class. Also, I have to mention that the exams feel more logical than classical exams. This is very different from the system in Nepal where one could show no visible work in an entire academic session but ace the exam and end up with an A.
The meaning of A
The meaning of A is different in the education system in Nepal compared to universities elsewhere. If a student ends up getting an A in Nepal, it means they have good knowledge of the subject matter. However, consistency, punctuality, presentation skills and discussion skills are unaccounted for. The grading system still only fulfills its objective if all these factors are accounted for.
Where does the Nepali education system actually stand? Is it where exam marks are simply converted to grade or does grade include all the above-mentioned factors? I would say midway. While some universities in Nepal tend to allocate a certain percentage for the final grade on the basis of a student's dedication throughout the semester (or year), the students who achieve more in exams usually get high points in that category.
Was I an A-Grade student in school?
If the grades were calculated the way it should have been, I wasn’t. I did well in exams but my efforts throughout my school life was least possible to not get me in trouble. I seldom completed my assignments, unless the teacher was strict and all the project work was just par to get me over the line. However, I was lucky to grasp the concepts of the class quicker than most. That helped me get good grades in exams with a lot less study hours.
Would I be an A-grade student if the grade considered all the elements I have been mentioning? Yes I would. My efforts would have been different if my assignments, project works and overall class presence was considered in the final grade. This is because I still consider myself as an academic student who would do his best to get an A. This would have changed the way I presented myself as a student. The habit of being consistent would come handy in jobs as they are more about experience and dedication rather than just knowledge.
What has changed now?
The education system in the USA has changed my approach a lot. Courses demand students to put in effort throughout the semester. As a Master’s student, my grade would probably matter for me to be shortlisted as a job candidate or candidate for further studies. The ‘A’ in my transcript now might not tell that I am someone with vast knowledge of the subject but it shows that I can be trusted with responsibilities and I would put constant effort to meet any deadlines in the job.
While an individual exam may not determine one’s future, consistent effort throughout an academic program can have a significant impact

Would you let your spouse sleep with your future self?
I asked him not knowing how he would take this thought experiment.
He paused for a moment and said absolutely no.
Not one from the future or from the past.
They are not allowed. In fact, very much unwelcome.
The “me’ from here, the one who is living in this linear moment, that’s the one with the warrant to be with her.
The rest of the remaining selves from there, beyond, yonder or anywhere else are ‘persona non grata’ whose existence, in a manner of speaking, is nonexistent.
As always, when I hear something as mind boggling as that, I get into some kind of meditative stupor. His answers got me into thinking really hard.
Do we or do we not, somehow, have this intricate love affair with ourselves?
And not just any selves but the one that’s sensing this present moment in time.
For me, it’s the one who is writing this sentence and not the one who began this article or the one ending it. This me, the one who is typing these letters and rummaging through the pool of thought is the one I know the most.
The one who began adn the one who will end this article are two sets of different people and neither of them is me, although I grew out of one and will end up being the other soon.
In essence, I am an in-betweener.
I have graduated out of one and am morphing into another. I am neither of them and yet I am both.
Think about crimes that boil out of rage. The ones that end up in the court where for the umpteenth time, a rueful apology is given for not being responsible for the crime committed by the version that is not the one now.
Husbands cheating on their wives, wives cheating on their husbands, teenagers embroiled in moody whims, road-rages, pregnancies, producing atomic bombs and then dropping them willy-nilly, going to war on wrong pretexts, starting a guerrilla war in a country already ravaged by poverty and then shamelessly arriving at a place where all those missteps don’t matter because the one over there is not here anymore.
Those of you who haven’t heard about ‘Twinkies defense’, here’s the story.
Many years ago, a man named Dan White shot and killed the mayor of San Francisco George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk.
These high-profile killings were based on the idea that White had consumed so much sugar from eating Twinkies (little sugared donuts) that he lost the ability for rational thought when committing the murders. The defense was actually trying to prove that White suffered from depression, and that his depressive state the week of the killings left him with a diminished capacity which caused him to act irrationally. Based on that defense, Dan White was let go. There were no charges filed against him and this brings us back to the moot I have been spewing all along.
This untenable mask wherein we reside and somehow find ourselves tethered to; we call it our authentic self, the present self. The self that supervenes all the other selves that live no more. We look back and regret the mistakes of our own making and we point our blaming finger at ourselves, but we do it with deceit. We point from here to there. We also look forward judgmentally and have anxieties about how our future self will hold up to that impeccable imagined moment. This moment, this self, is the wisest and omniscient toward both the present and the past, it appears.
Consider for a brief moment then, what it would mean if every experienced moment precipitated into a cloned version with the experience of that particular moment. Every thought would create a new person, and each would see things in his own light.
And since ideas, precepts, percepts, and perches will not be identical, there will always be inconsistencies with one version holding up the mantle of truth while others irreconcilably fighting back under the similar pretext of their own making.
Imagine that world, where you find yourself fighting among your own inconsistencies. Would you want that? And, more importantly.
Are you not there already?

I am from Pokhara, an alluring city in Nepal well-known for its impeccable green beauty and unique landscapes. Mostly, my morning starts with an invigorating walk in nature and mesmerizing views of mountains, whereas my evening is filled with cycling in the hills and easing off alongshore, savoring the sun casting long shadows on the lake. Whether I am worn out or worry-free, I often find myself relishing being near different lakes, as it is home to seven lakes. My friends from other places generally envied the nighttime cityscape. Much as I enjoy the lively nightlife on the streets of Lakeside, I equally prefer going sightseeing around the valley, which is usually just a 20–30 minute ride from my home.

One night, I took my grandpa to one of the viewpoints of the city on the hill. I parked the scooter, and we rested on the bench. I love to behold the scene that night offers. As darkness deepened, the city lights grew more intense, creating a breathtaking spectacle that captured the essence of urban vitality. While I adored bright city lights, my grandpa beside me smiled in reminiscence. With a mosaic of pauses and whispers, he recalled fragments of memories. He used to walk to the same place with his friends for almost two hours after exhausting work in the fields and lie down on the ground, where stargazing felt like finding solace in the boundless beauty. He said, ""The freshness of the air, moisture of the soil, and timeless dance of the stars amazed us, and fatigue fell behind."" Adding on that, I told him how much astronomy fascinates me with the presence of the myriad of constellations, the solar system, shimmering stars, and many more things. He was astonished by the knowledge I had at my age. I even showed him videos of the space via the internet—typical Gen Z behavior. The whole universe stored on the phone amazed him. In this day and age, impossibly distant creatures have become intimately close through the internet. As per recent data, there are 5.18 billion internet users worldwide, which amounts to 64.6% of the global population. My grandpa raised an eyebrow at the unimagined changes happening around the world and sighed. After some comfortable silence, where we deemed our enjoyment distinct, we returned home.
As a Pokhreli (someone whose hometown is Pokhara), can you even live without planning a trek? Simply, no. Pokhara is the gateway to plenty of mountain treks, and a backpack is a must. In October, when nature captivates hearts and minds with its rich colors and crisp air, my friends and I left to embark on a journey via the glorious trials of Annapurna Base Camp. For five days, we stepped up and down, with every turn unfolding exquisite vistas that seemed straight out of a painting. There was warmth amid the growing leaves and flowing rivers in the frigid weather. Tears welled up in my eyes when they met the ring of mountains changing colors in the evening. 'My goddess, What a beauty!' is something that I uttered at each step. The local foods prepared by hospitable Gurung people ignited our chicken legs and immobile bodies, whereas the dedication of the porter inspired us to keep up the spirit. Though I gained enriching experiences, it was not completely easy.

The obligation to wake up early to catch the view in the freezing winter made me yearn for the mild temperature of Pokhara. Walking for six-seven hours per day on uneven and steep terrain carrying an overpacked bag, I missed my scooter and its storage often. Sleeping on the tables of the dining hall owing to seasonality and limited rooms with a single layer of blanket in the mountain region was an antsy adventure. Nevertheless, as we climbed to higher altitudes, we were lost in the pristine night sky views, and all the hardship felt worthwhile. The awe-inspiring landscapes of mountains and the vastness of the cosmos reduced our mental and physical fatigue. After a wearisome walk all day, stargazing soothes the aches unimaginably. At that time, I couldn't help recalling my grandpa's words. I was living his regular life for a few days. I was fulfilled.
When I returned home with rosy cheeks and nose after the trek, I contemplated the makeover we have done of nature. As usual, I left for the light at night on the hillside. I remembered the unfavorable impact of a load-shedding era on our regular lives before a decade. There were days when my parents used to check our daily routine to decide whether to cook rice in a rice cooker or a pressure cooker and I had to finish homework before sunset. In comparison, 24/7 facilities of lights have made our life much easier. As someone whose childhood passed in darkness, the brightness of bulbs bewitched me. But while finding joy in artificial lights, starry skies are pushed beyond our sight. In urban areas, where over 80% of the world's population lives, there is maximum interference from artificial lights invading night skies. Technological advancement has not only contributed to air, land and water pollution but elevated light pollution. It hinders stargazing as well as affects human health causing sleep disturbance, obesity, diabetes and certain cancers. Also, it impacts animals' and plants' circadian rhythms as they depend on the day-and-night cycle of light and darkness for their survival.

With time, we hit triumph in various aspects ensuring the quality of life, but we failed to entwine the gifts of mother earth. As much as we need light, it's crucial to ensure lights are not affecting the brightness of the sky by reducing the unnecessary use of bulbs in homes and streets. As I behold the city from far, I think about how pleasurable it would be if we could gather for 'Earth hour' when all electrical appliance power will be turned off, saving electricity and energy too, and we could get lost in awe. Wrapping my feelings, I reach home and switch off the doorway light that often remains on and lie on my bed.
Now, as I carry my grandpa's memories and have time to create mine, I wonder about the stories of the coming generations. Will my children stargaze sitting on the bench from the hillside or travel to hunt in remote areas which perhaps will be scarce in view of rapid urbanization and industrialization unaccompanied by sustainability? Anyway, they will have their own tale to tell.

In an agricultural country like Nepal, where 66% of the population are farmers, and livestock covers 32% of agricultural GDP, one would expect the dairy industry to flourish as a testament to their toil. Yet, reality paints a different picture, revealing a disheartening tale of missed opportunities and untapped potential. The Milk Industry in Nepal has long been plagued by inefficiency and financial losses, primarily represented by the struggles faced by the Dairy Development Corporation (DDC). For decades, this state-owned entity has failed to achieve profitability, resulting in significant financial burdens on the nation’s hardworking taxpayers. This article delves into the pressing need for the privatization of Nepal's state owned DDC, highlighting its inefficiencies and the implications of its continued financial strain on the taxpayers. The article also advocates for a transition of the role of government in this sector that would alleviate this burden and foster a more vibrant and self-sustaining industry.
Firstly, let’s start by talking about the market for milk in Nepal. As per FAO/WHO, the demand for milk in Nepal is 92 liters per person per year, and the country produces 79 liters per person annually. It is estimated that the average current deficit is around 550,000 liters of fluid milk per day with 10-20 % variability during different seasons. According to the Department of Livestock Services (DLS), production is increasing at a rate of 3.4 % annually, but demand is growing at 8%. The average cost of per liter milk production in Nepal is around Rs 56.32. It is lowest in Ilam at Rs 45.37 per liter and highest in Sarlahi, at Rs 67 per liter.
When it comes to dairy development in Nepal DDC is a living history. However, like other state-owned enterprises in Nepal, it has inbuilt difficulties and incompetency. DDC is a significant player in the market, handling a disproportionately high share of 40% of milk production in the country. Regardless of a substantial market share over the past five years, the corporation has been experiencing massive financial losses. In the fiscal years 2019/20 and 2020/21, the company incurred losses of Rs 158.3 million and Rs 168 million, respectively. The loss trend continues in the year 2022 and 2023 which is substantiated by ongoing protests across various regions in Nepal, led by milk farmers affected by DDC's untimely payment practices. While other dairy companies are flourishing and expanding their portfolio DDC’s continuous loss alone is enough to prove its incompetency. Let’s delve deeper into the reasons behind the inefficiencies of the DDC, shedding light on the factors that have led to its downfall.
Supply Chain Incompetency
In 2020, DDC requested a concessional loan of Rs 300 million from the Ministry of Finance, facilitated through the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development. DDC had been unable to pay farmers for their milk for the past three months. According to them, there was approximately Rs 1 billion worth of dairy products in stock as they were not able to sell the product. DDC had also requested a subsidy of Rs 5 per liter from the Ministry of Agriculture for the consumption of 17 million liters of milk. This highlights a significant supply chain inefficiency as DDC, despite being a majority shareholder in the market, fails to capitalize on the existing deficit of 550,000 liters per day in the milk market.
Lack of Efficient Decision Making
During COVID, after DDC bought up to 100,000 liters of milk every day, they had problems managing the milk. Hence, the provincial government provided  Rs 50 million grant to upgrade the powder plant to be able to operate 24 hours a day and establish a new ice bank. The Biratnagar Milk Supply Scheme (BMSS), which upgraded the powder plant by expecting an increase in milk collection, is now, at times, completely non-operational till the interval of up to half a year due to insufficient milk collection. The BMSS is currently collecting 10,000 liters of milk daily. During the same period last year, the daily collection was 22,000 liters. Not only is DDC unable to meet the market demand, it has stopped the production of cheese. Their ghee has not been sent to the market for months. The short-term thinking and lack of foresightedness among the decision-makers have cost the taxpayers in millions.
Untimely Payment to Suppliers
In March 2023, the government fixed the minimum purchase price of raw milk containing four units of fat at Rs 65 per liter for the farmers. However, Farmers opt to sell their milk to private companies instead of DDC due to the private sector's provision of more competitive pricing and timely payment, thereby aligning with their economic interests. Private industries are buying milk by paying Rs 5-10 more per liter. The private sector is giving advance payment to the cooperatives, but DDC has been buying milk on credit for two months. Among the farmers, DDC has been known as a 'slow pay' company. The milk collection capacity of BMSS has been decreasing at a rate of 50 percent every year for the past few years. The Biratnagar project is in trouble as DDC is unable to bring milk from Ilam, where it collects the most milk. Until three years ago, about 12,000 liters of milk was collected daily from Ilam, now 3,000 liters are collected daily. Farmers are unwilling to sell milk to DDC due to due to lack of timely payment. Hence, the reluctance of farmers to sell milk to DDC, despite the milk production capacity of Nepal remaining intact, highlights the perceived inefficiency of DDC in effectively engaging with farmers and establishing a mutually beneficial relationship. This demonstrates the superior efficiency of the private sector in this industry, as it not only offers competitive prices to farmers but also manages to sell milk to consumers at the same price as DDC. Consequently, this approach avoids any loss of taxpayers' money.
Inefficient Use of Resources
In Nepal, there are two seasons based on milk production at the farmers' level. During the lean season, the demand for milk is higher than the supply and during the flush season, the demand is lower than the supply. Even today, DDC is not able to buy all the milk offered by the farmers, especially during the flush season. As a consequence, DDC imposes a milk holiday on certain days during the period when they do not buy any milk from the farmers. On the other hand, during the lean season, DDC has either been importing skimmed milk powder to meet consumer demand or buying milk from private companies. In the Indian market, the base price of milk stands at Rs 70 per liter, whereas in Nepal, it is merely Rs 64 per liter. The inability of DDC to powder and store milk exclusively during the flush season not only leads to significant financial losses for the organization but also imposes these losses on the general public. If private companies can efficiently utilize resources and maintain a consistent price throughout all seasons, there is little justification for bailing out DDC, which has been purchased from these very private companies at the expense of public losses.
Corruption and Lack of Accountability
Lack of accountability and corruption is a very common cause of inefficiency of Public Enterprises in Nepal. The stakeholders often act on their self-interests rather than the interests of the organization as they have very little incentive to maximize the organizational profit. Additionally, the government often appoints unqualified or underqualified individuals to top positions based on political connections rather than merit, resulting in poor decision-making, lack of accountability, and a culture of corruption. DDC is indifferent to this and has been plagued by inefficiency due to rampant corruption within the organization. This has hindered the corporation's ability to fulfill its objectives and has negatively impacted its overall performance. One glaring example is highlighted in a report from 2016 which exposed DDC officials who were found involved in accepting commissions. Such unethical practices not only undermine the corporation's integrity but also result in the misallocation of resources and compromised decision-making processes. When officials prioritize personal gain over the interests of the organization, it leads to inefficiencies in the procurement, production, and distribution of dairy products.
Furthermore, another report shed light on another form of corruption within DDC which revealed instances where service-seekers were forced to pay bribes to officials in Saptari DDC. This kind of extortion erodes public trust in the corporation and discourages genuine service-seekers from engaging with the organization. It also creates an uneven playing field, where those with connections or the ability to pay bribes receive preferential treatment, further exacerbating the inefficiencies of the organization.
Lack of Audit Reports
The absence of audit reports of DDC for seven consecutive years raises significant questions about the financial transparency and accountability of the organization. Audits play a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of financial statements, detecting fraud or mismanagement, and providing insights into the overall financial health of a company. The lack of audits undermines these essential functions, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and casting doubts on the financial integrity of DDC. These reasons could range from administrative negligence to deliberate attempts to conceal financial irregularities. This raises an alarming question as to why no one has taken action or asked questions about the missing audits. This is related to accountability and governance mechanisms of DDC and the government itself. It is crucial for stakeholders, including government authorities, regulatory bodies, and the general public, to demand transparency and seek answers regarding the reasons behind the missing audits. Without regular audits, it becomes difficult to assess financial performance, identify areas for improvement, and ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Lack of transparency in the organization has led to mismanagement, corruption, and resource wastage, further hindering the efficiency of DDC.
To conclude, to enhance efficiency and improve the dairy market in Nepal, it is imperative for the government to adopt effective policies that focus on fostering a thriving milk industry rather than directly engaging in business operations. For instance, one of the major factors contributing to the low milk production in Nepal is the limited milk yield of the local cow breeds. Currently, only 5% of the cattle in Nepal are pure breeds such as Holstein and Jersey, which are known for their higher yield. To address this issue, Nepali farmers have resorted to artificial insemination (AI) to crossbreed their local cattle with Holstein and Jersey breeds. However, despite these efforts, the average milk yield per cow ranges from 500 to 2,000 liters per year, which falls short of desired levels. To tackle these challenges and revitalize the dairy market, the government can facilitate the import of high-yielding dairy cows. By streamlining the process and making it more accessible for businesses and corporations to import such cows, Nepal can significantly boost milk production.
Similarly, encouraging foreign direct investment (FDI) in the dairy sector can yield substantial benefits. For instance, if renowned brands like Amul are allowed to enter Nepal, they can bring advanced technologies, expertise, and cooperative models. It is important to dispel the misconception spread by interest groups that such investment will negatively impact local milk farmers. In reality, international brands will still rely on local farmers for their milk supply. Additionally, the comparative affordability of milk in Nepal compared to neighboring India ensures that Nepali farmers will not suffer from a lack of demand. In fact, increased competition and demand from foreign brands entering the market will incentivize farmers to produce more milk. Hence, the government should prioritize the best interests of the overall population rather than succumbing to pressure from interest groups.
Lastly, the government must take decisive steps to ensure free market competition in the dairy sector and limit its crucial role in standardizing milk quality through the implementation of effective quality control measures. Introducing a free-market framework and fostering healthy competition are essential as they empower the market to self-regulate, eliminating substandard milk products that fall short of meeting consumer demands. In a truly free market, local participants will be driven to standardize their milk products to compete effectively. As a result, only the highest quality milk will prevail in the market, benefiting consumers by guaranteeing their access to safe and nutritious dairy products. Embracing such a market-oriented approach is pivotal for the industry's long-term growth and sustainability, as it encourages innovation, efficiency, and the continual improvement of product offerings. By facilitating an environment where quality is the hallmark, the government can inspire consumer trust, foster economic development, and position Nepal's dairy sector as a beacon of excellence both domestically and internationally.

Universities in Nepal, along with their numerous affiliated colleges in various domains of specialization, have gradually acknowledged and embraced the importance of research as an integral part of their academic practices. After all, research activities enable scholars in any domain of knowledge—sociology, economics, education, engineering, or management—to either examine or explore the relationship between their academic learning and practices, preferences, possibilities, and problems that are emerging in real-world settings. Through research activities, scholars can also acquire essential professional skills like the application of concepts, processes, steps, and theories learned in academia for the analysis of real-world problems, data management, inference, contextualization, and evidence-based interpretations. As a result, educational institutions associated with Nepali higher education regularly organize conferences, seminars, research workshops, and data analysis training sessions to support their scholars and faculty members with publications and participation in different conferences.
However, so much of the research-based knowledge and evidence generated in Nepali academia never gets implemented in practice that there is a huge research-professional practice gap in Nepali higher education. Therefore, it is no surprise that the libraries of universities find it worthless to keep archives of graduate projects, post-graduate theses, and dissertations; hence, after some time, most of them are simply sold off to scrap dealers.
Since university educators, research scholars, and professors observe and analyze professional and social realities from their academic norms and hypotheses, there is a common assumption that academics don’t produce anything useful for society, the economy, or business in practical or applied terms. This assumption is also justified by the fact that in Nepali academic circles, so much of the research activities are framed on the basis of reviews of existing theories, concepts, and published literature, or approaches to research that some professors and faculty members presume to be most reliable and valid. Hence, academic research lacks proper grounding in research problems, contextual knowledge gaps, practices, and selections of factors and issues that are observable and emerging in a real-world setting.
As we can observe in management studies, where thousands of dissertations are completed with reference to the Nepali financial sector, this sector is utterly aloof, disinterested, and indifferent to the knowledge and evidence generated by these research works. After all, just because there is a concept doesn't mean that the problems and practices of commercial banks can be grounded in that conceptual framework; relationships between concepts in theory may not have any relation to practice. For example, work-life balance may be an emerging concept in management, but to most professionals working in the banking sector, the issue of balancing work and life may never occur to their minds in spite of all the hectic schedules, stress, and workloads. Perhaps imbalances between work and life are integral part of the competitive working culture of commercial banks.
Hence, publication for the sake of publication can be a criteria for professor tenure and university ranking, but that is certainly not a concern for any dynamic, competitive, and vibrant organization like a commercial bank. That is why most of the students are not passionate about doing their theses and want to outsource the process or streamline it with every possible shortcut. Even if they publish research in a highly ranked journal, they know it has zero professional or financial value beyond the walls of the university.
More importantly, when academic research occurs within operative closures, where none of the research activities move out of the university system, various malpractices, misuses, and manipulations also begin to emerge, as we see when a senior professor or a dean publishes journal articles with scholars or young lecturers as co-authors, and we don't know who among them has contributed the most to the final research paper or if the names of others have simply been added due to hierarchy or power structure. That is why we can find in Nepal the names of some people hanging behind as co-authors in different research papers, although they don’t themselves have any specializations in that domain of knowledge. Hence, in most cases, academic research only remains a self-maximizing tool for professors, deans and senior lecturers, despite the agony and hard work of young faculty members and scholars.
Moreover, when we analyze this isolated and self-referential aspect of academic research happening in Nepali higher education, we also realize why universities are not developing their students into scientists, engineers, innovators, entrepreneurs, disruptive thinkers, system designers, theorists, and paradigm shifters capable of solving real-life problems and making contributions to the progress of overall society. Our professors and lecturers have only remained artists, admiring their own creations with utter arrogance and self-admiration, whereas most people outside their close system are not interested in their art. As a result of this self-admiring tendency, we observe that different departments of universities keep on producing research dissertations and articles on different events, experiences, and circumstances using the same research methodologies over and over again.
However, to remain competitive, relevant, and vibrant in an international market, universities in Nepal need to undertake research activities that have applied value for scientific, business, industrial, and technological development, where evidence, trends, tendencies and interpretations generated through research have analytical, practical, decision-making, and problem-solving potential for businesses and entrepreneurs. Likewise, universities, rather than operating as a closed system, need to collaborate with stakeholders in higher education through knowledge sharing platforms to ground their research activities in real-world issues and ground-based observations that are pertinent to professionals and decision-makers in public and private institutions so that research findings generated in institutions of higher learning are applicable for expanding and enhancing the quality, sustainability, optimization, efficacy, and effectiveness of professional practices.
More importantly, it is for universities in Nepal to realize that research with scientific, innovative, social, and professional potentials, utility, and relevance not only enhances the perceived value and reputation of Nepali universities and educational institutions of higher education in terms of grants, market outreach, funds, and investment collaborations but also indicates to potential students that universities in Nepal, like foreign academic institutions, are also involved in solving real-life scientific, social, economic, business, and industrial problems.

It appears that the current generation of loving couples getting married in Nepal in an urban context are enchanted and enthralled by the idea of a soulmate. Hence, the idea of someone being your soulmate keeps trending on different social networking sites as an ideal version of being in love together. Although the current generation of loving couples has an idealized image of a soulmate, in reality, for many people, the idea of finding and living with a social mate remains limited to mere appearances—just a tagline posted along with a visual representation of togetherness shared on different social networking sites.
Our everyday idea about the soulmate falls short of its ideals because we rely on imitations of plastic images of love trending in different mediums of pop culture, compare and contrast our possible loving partners with superficial expressions of other loving couples, and also follow the suggestions and guidelines of other people to identify and determine our soulmate. Similarly, we have misguided expectations about a soulmate as someone who brings a sense of security and feelings of comfort, along with the promise of everlasting love, into our lives.
Besides, our criteria for falling in love with another person are such that we give more preference and priority to what the person has, like a bank balance, a green card, a dependent visa, social status, and a handsome or beautiful face, than to who he or she is as a person with inner human qualities such as honesty, trustworthiness, understanding, commitment, and caring.
Many people miss their soulmates because they are so out of touch with their inner lives as individuals that they remain unaware of the person who is carrying the beats of her heart inside his own. Soulmates get married because they are for each other, not for any other reason.
More importantly, without anything as such to connect with, enrich, and nourish a loving relationship together from within, being in love without a soulmate becomes utterly boring, shallow, lost in appearances, and meaningless. Being in love without a soulmate is a tedious struggle of finding one temporary delight after another in the outer world to justify and demonstrate the shallow and soulless love people have for each other.
The idea of each of us having a soulmate was first put forth by Greek philosopher Plato, who in his seminal work Symposium stated that each of us has another half of our own soul in another physical body; hence, as human beings, we have this inner, irresistible yearning for that interconnection with another being that would make us feel undivided and complete, and as long as soulmates remain separated, there will always be an inner sense of lack, as if things are missing out, out of touch, shallow, and incomplete.
Similarly, in Hindu religious tradition, we have the divine union between Goddess Parvati and Lord Shiva as Shiva and Shakti expressed in a singular being, Ardhanarishwar; this mythological narrative is a symbolic representation of reunion between soulmates. Indeed, the struggles and sacrifices of Devi Parvati to belong with Lord Shiva indicate that when it comes to a spiritual journey to find a soulmate, it is not about what other people say or what options or preferences you have; to find a soulmate, you must exercise your freedom, follow your inner voice and its determination, and stand strong with your courage. First, you have to connect and stand firm on your true self to find your true lover.
Hence, to get in touch with your soulmate, first of all, you need to listen to the soft whisper reverberating from your heart that gently tells you she may not be the charming person of your dreams, but it feels as if even as strangers, we have already met for thousands of times. There may have been other lovers of youth, beauty, possession, admiration, and passion, but only she can reach deep inside your heart and understand you just the way you are.
Finding your soulmate would be like stumbling onto someone you are surprised to realize has been shaped and carved like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that fit together only with you. With your soulmate, you get that feeling of being at ease within yourself, and there is no need for any other stimulus or incentive apart from each other’s presence to get a sense of interconnection out of this relationship.
Moreover, soulmates are two individuals who have realized that promising romantic love forever is a lie. Falling in love is easy, but the art of remaining committed to each other in love takes many years of practice to perfect. Even when their love is the glue that binds them together, soulmates understand that for their relationship to last, they need to support each other's motivations, interests, and inspirations and find commonalities between them.
Being in love as soulmates means that we are both willing to make struggles and sacrifices for each other because we both realize that our love has the potential to improve, transform, redefine, and make the best out of our lives altogether. Besides, soulmates don’t play the game of pretending to remain at the center of each other’s attention, and they don't want the other person to become the shadow of their expectations, anticipations, and projections.
To conclude, soulmates are two individuals with a sense of shared self that allows them to blend in, support, and sustain each other's beings together. Where there are differences, soulmates supplement and become each other’s inspiration and strength, and where there are similarities, they explore, enhance, and enjoy their mutual interests and passions together. When soulmates sit together and engage in laughter, dialogue, making love, silence, or discussions, they realize that their loving relationship gives their lives a sense of purpose together, which makes them feel complete and inseparable from each other.

Those words from my lovely wife ended our argument in the kitchen last night.
The night before that, a minor difference in opinion had flickered into a tiny spark and by the time Hegel got involved the next day, it had turned into an inferno.
Before we move on, let’s get to know a little about Hegel so it can help us understand where these two loving souls, my wife and I, usually depart and seldom meet again.
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a German Philosopher and was considered as the most important figures in German philosophy and one of the founding figures of modern Western philosophy. Leaving all the things he’s said aside, the one thing that has struck a chord with me is his theory on “shape of consciousness”. 
Hegel says simply put, we cannot trust the certitude of our sense organs, also called sense-certainty, because that certitude is embroiled in limitations. Add to that, the human consciousness, and language upon which all sense-making is forced. That leaves no room for subjective agency. Our means of understanding our reality are encouraged, sustained, inspired, and tolerated by those sets of very weak and humanistic attributes. We are flawed in our take of our reality because the moment we set our eyes on something, it takes a form of what it means for us. 
Not what it is in its real essence, but what it means to a human mind.
Imagine a botanist, a wood cutter and a CEO of a furniture company taking a walk in a forest. What they see when they look around are trees and nothing but trees. 
In essence what a tree is, in-itself, they will never know. They cannot catch themselves seeing those trees from anywhere else beyond what their human mind lets them see.
The botanist will see the trees in terms of cambiums and apical meristem. 
The woodcutter will see those trees in terms of his livelihood and his children’s tuition.
The CEO will see them in terms of how many desks his company could produce from the wood of those trees.
The tree’s essence, what it is, and why it is what it is, can never find a place of its individuality because the human mind, limited within its Hegelian purview, will eat up that possibility before anything else.
The tree can never be a tree in itself. Instead, it must be a tree for those three people.
Thomas Nagel, one of my other to-go thinkers wrote a paper back in 1974 titled ‘What is it like to be a bat?’ There is no amount of knowledge or information about a bat that can tell us what it feels like to be a bat within the confines of its bat consciousness. 
Its hunger, its love, its breezing along the meandering swoops and its revulsions against other fellow bats--those we shall never know. The best we could do is anthropomorphize it, like we always do in animation movies where animals tend to live up to human aspirations. 
A human mind is incapable of experiencing a bat’s experience and therefore will never know how a bat might feel. There simply is not a way for anyone of us to know. Let’s be totally asserted on that truth.
In the similar manner, a botanist, a woodcutter, and my lovely wife, how’s their experience any more different from the run-down of that bat’s experience we could relate to?
Fundamentally, their personal experience that’s accessible only to them, be it during the stroll in the forest or the grunt in the kitchen, are theirs to have. I can sit here and try to relativize a woodcutter’s coveting or my wife’s annoyances, but that won’t move the dial if their shape of consciousness is absent from my reach. I can never know how she feels if I can’t own her in totality.
And this is where Hegel comes along to enlighten the predicament of the misrepresentations that becomes a foundational springboard in understanding the shape of the other person’s consciousness.
Our minds, our feelings and everything we claim as ours are cusped within the confines of our personal sense-making. Our experiences become relatable only if we can find a medium to universalize it in terms of human graces or grunts.
I don’t know if Hegel can truly do my wife’s dishes or not.
I am positive he will not because he died long before both of us were born.
Nonetheless, Hegel does remind us that in absence of common reference, our words will fail us miserably. 
And when that happens our silence, perhaps, will hold more meaning.

A dear friend that I have known for decades took his life last week leaving behind a wife, two children and many of us who have not been able to claim back our sanity. There are ten thousand unrelenting questions that are hitting hard on us, and they are not easily going away. It’s been an unsettling week for all of us.
When a tragedy like this happens, it doesn’t take place amidst the clamor of reason and resonance.
Instead, a decision like this is made in the retreat of a cool, calm, and collected mind. At least, that’s what Karl Menninger meditates in ‘Man against Himself’, a brilliant psychiatrist who tries to comprehend why an individual wishes to put himself in a harm’s way from which he cannot, except by suicide, escape from his life.
In other words, if for his own unconscious purpose, a man brings about an apparent justification in external reality for self-destruction, then the unconscious purposes are of more significance in understanding the suicide than the apparently simple, inevitable, external circumstance that are observable to the public. For folks like you and me, the laziest and the most reckless way to make sense of someone’s decision is to try to understand his subjective decision from an objective point of view.
What Menninger is saying humbly is this.
What happens out there are particles simply hitting each other and producing a state of affairs that, when viewed from a frog’s point of view or a bird eye-view, are nothing but occasions passing along space and time. However, when we introduce a human mind to that same state of affairs, everything changes. 
Humans carry an unhealthy number of covenants, rules, positivity, and ought-to-be-ness that sometimes are anti-life. It works more against them than for them. 
In essence, what kills a man under such circumstances is not what’s out there in the world but what’s within him. His provisional compass becomes the contingent arbiter, the judge, the jury, and the noose that can take away his life. At least, that’s what happened with my friend, it looks like.
I can only imagine or perhaps not, what must have gone through his mind in those last forlorn moments of despair and disquietude. I will never find out how many sins he thought he had committed when he compared his external world to Bhagavat Geeta that espouses on being a good human being. I will never find out how much short he found himself in the eyes of Hindu Gods and other deities that had, in his last moments, become toxic for him.
Jordan Peterson is a clinical psychiatrist who perhaps is the most articulate man alive on our planet- at least that’s what the New York Times quotes him to be. 
Peterson makes an appeal to all, not to advise another human being on what should or should not be done, simply because you may screw up that person’s life. It doesn’t matter where such guidance comes from. 
Be it from the voice from heaven or from the Apollo of Delphi or from our own Krishna’s chariots from Kurukshetra. Where they come from is irrelevant but what they render to a human mind is absolutely calamitous.
These oracular voices tend to be more harmful and are totally responsible for human suffering. They create a paradigm in men upon which he is constrained to build up his sense of right and wrong. And life, as you all know, is a roller coaster ride, simply because there’s always a chance for us to spill out of that paradigm. 
Our agency, perhaps our only tool to understand the reality may not always square perfectly with Bhagavad Gita’s diatribes against the sins that men are capable of committing. And that is exactly why no one should be damned because none can control the reality of the world. There seems no room for agency in a world of neural impulses, chemical reactions, and bone and muscle movements. Even if we add sensations, perceptions, and feelings we don’t get action, or doing—there is only what happens.
Under such conditions, my friend who perhaps didn’t find his external reality 'squarely checked’ with his internal covenants saw no point in prolonging his life because he must have gotten lost on his way with no structure to guide him through. The virtues that he adhered so deeply had no place in the world he found himself in. The gods were gone.
He must have found himself in that forlorn Nietzschean world where god lived no more.
There were two ways to fix his problem from what I can tell.
First one was to fix the reality which essentially meant to reorganize the particles that was noumenally visible to him so it would evenly square with his virtues. 
The second was to kill the gods so the world would become livable where he could breathe again.
Unfortunately, both options were not available to him. And the one that he did choose, only that made all the difference to him.

With the massive popularity and abundance of spiritual leaders, gurus, religious groups, religious media channels, and self-help publications, the concept of spirituality has become an integral part of our collective psyche. As a result, many people believe that spiritual perspectives, techniques, and exercises can be applied to solve various mental health issues and educational and behavioral problems in modern society and influence people to make healthy lifestyle choices and meaningful life decisions. However, most often, I find this term overused, misused, confused, and even utterly commercialized.
For example, gurus, meditation teachers, mystics, yogic masters, and preachers package their spiritual techniques and craft their presence in such a way that their spiritual teaching resonates as informative, entertaining, alluring, and incentivized for a specific age group, gender, generation, profession, and for people with a specific way of life, attitude, and purchasing power. And these days, spirituality is no longer something that can be obtained without generous contributions; most of the spiritual reliefs available on the market have a price tag stitched around them.
Our familiar assumptions also limit our understanding of spirituality to becoming members of a spiritual sect, listening to spiritual teachers, following their instructions, and reading spiritual books regularly. But to become spiritual, one does not have to join an esoteric cult, put on religious markers, receive the spiritual energy transmission of a guru and his grace, or uncritically digest his outrageous teaching.
Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, observed that, based on our infantile experiences, it is part of human psychology to yearn for a father figure who can guide us through this chaotic, unpredictable, and confusing world. And there are different gurus, mystics, evangelists, and spiritual masters in the spiritual market ready to take up this role as father figures because, as humans, we want to live a meaningful life, find answers to the questions about our being and suffering, and overcome the fear of death. Besides, all of us also have that feeling of being unsatisfied by material comforts, things, and achievements.
As a spiritual person, I am not opposed to anyone following any spiritual teacher; however, as a follower, you must be critical enough to question their self-contradictory and baseless statements, and also, under the guise of spiritual growth, you shouldn’t be exploited, made vulnerable, or demanded to make irrational commitments and actions. We also need to realize that nobody in this world has a truth that doesn’t need to be proved. I have met hundreds of spiritual teachers from different religious traditions, but I never forgot to keep my critical mind open. After all, the word ""spiritual"" comes from a Latin word meaning ""to breathe freely."" As a result, becoming a free spirit—those who dare to challenge traditional beliefs, let go, and celebrate their liberation—is also a part of human spirituality.
As human existence is divided into mind and matter, we need abstract and soulful substances like poetry, ideas, music, art, literature, philosophy, self-inquiry, and reflections to help us find meaning and significance in our outer actions, associations, objectives, and outcomes from our inner perspectives. In other words, to live a meaningful life, we need to find something—music, art, poetry, meditation, philosophy, or writing—that allows us to explore and engage with the outside world while maintaining our inner sense of balance, detachment, calmness, maturity, and acceptance. Hence, spirituality is a search for an equilibrium point that balances our inner and outer lives.
Spirituality awakens to a living reality that is self-sufficient in itself, and nothing can be more spiritual than living in the world, where you find events, occasions, situations, relationships, explorations, and experiences that can take you out of yourself and connect you with everyone and everything around you. We can also recognize our relative insignificance in the universe when we temporarily dissolve our egos. Similarly, spirituality urges us to embrace, adjust to, and enjoy all the recklessness and paradoxes of human life. There are contractions and confusions everywhere, but these paradoxes also make life deep, dynamic, vibrant, improbable, creative, and exciting.
Surely, life is unfair and unpredictable, and as human beings, we have to deal with lots of people, events, occurrences, and outcomes that we don't like. As everything ends, every moment of life we live, touch, love, reflect on, listen to, connect with, and experience is special, specific, unrepeatable, and unparalleled. Hence, the journey of life becomes more spiritually meaningful than its presumed destinations. This is the only life we have; therefore, everything we do, discover, relate to, and create becomes significant and valuable because we will never have another opportunity to relive and restore those fleeting moments of life. After all, nothing can be more spiritual than to breathe in a world already overflowing with life, rhythm, a sense of wonder, beauty, and mystery.
With intensity, depth of engagement, thoughtfulness, and passion, everything from meditation, yoga, and dance to driving, climbing mountains, having conversations, and having a cup of tea becomes a meaning-making process that is also spiritually enriching. Human spirituality is not something separate from our everyday lives. For example, by reading Chekhov, walking around in the woods, writing poetry, teaching, gazing at the stars, playing with my daughter, and learning the guitar, I am able to engage in a meaning-making process and also feel the connectedness of my being with other beings and nature. And there are numerous other ways to celebrate our spirituality in the midst of our daily activities and practices. Hence, spirituality is not the exclusive property of people with certain levels of spiritual awakening, and we do not need their blessings to become spiritual.
More importantly, there is no need to elevate specific spiritual practices and religious rituals above any other ordinary human activities. With a little forethought, emotion engagement, love, passion, depth in involvement, and awareness in every ounce of our fleeting human existence, we can spiritualize our individual lives.

In the age of consumerism, we as individuals are forming our mindsets and behaviors based on what we have learned from different advertisements, social media contents, blog posts, expert opinions, TikTok, celebrity endorsements on Instagram, TV reality shows, the latest viral trends and contents, product positioning, celebrity lifestyles, movies, and so on.
As a result, we are influenced by the suggestions, persuasions, and symbolic meaning we have derived from these sources and develop our taste, preferences, decisions, comparisons, and lifestyle choices accordingly.
Similarly, we also learn so much about loving relationships from the narratives of love symbolized in movies and songs. Likewise, we like to read guidebooks on the art of loving to enhance our love, replicate the love lives of different social media influencers, and make love decisions based on consumer values of use and disposal. When it comes to choosing gifts for your girlfriend, you also seek expert advice and adhere to their guidelines in order to provide her with the ultimate experience of your love.
Just to give an example of this learning because of the influence of pop songs these days, for modern lovers, breakup has simply become a natural or obvious stage of the love cycle,  comparable to any other product life cycle where, after peak experiences of love, there will be decline and discontinuity.
Being in love also becomes useless when excitement begins to weaken and the boredom of repetition starts to creep in, and at that moment, you can ""shake it off,"" as Taylor Swift reminded us; indeed, if you can't make him stay, you can at least shake him off. Breakups aren't tragic, brokenhearted, or sad. Don't waste your emotions grieving over him; save your emotions for someone else you'll find again. Now you are better off being apart than together, as “The Breakup Song” lyrics from ""Ae Dil Hai Mushkil"" remind us, and breakups have become just another reason to reignite your passion, take charge of your life again, and party with friends rather than hang on and grieve over a stale relationship.
Likewise, we feel that exchanging various products developed as gifts and engaging in modern-day love rituals would prolong, strengthen, and enrich our loving relationships. Modern-day love rituals like Rose, Chocolate, and Teddy Days, candlelight dinners, Valentine's Day gift packages, and diamond rings and bracelets make so much sense in consumer culture because the products and services that are available in the market can be used to signify and express a person's quantum of love.
Love has surely become costly. With so many products and services in the consumer market that symbolize and signify different features, dimensions, depths, and expressions of love, lovers need to have sufficient purchasing power to exchange, enjoy, and experience love in all its colors, exuberance, and facets.
From restaurants, vacations, shopping, birthday celebrations, night outs, romantic dates, and weekly gifts to movie theaters, different portions of love hang everywhere, and you need to purchase them to enrich your loving relationships. Indeed, you can consume these products and services with your partner in order to enhance your experience of being in love and make it more satisfying and exciting.
Falling in love in the age of consumerism becomes so irrelevant, less exciting, dull, and meaningless if you can't buy your portion of love.
As a result, much of human love and relationship in this consumer age is nurtured by an individual's consuming capacity and purchasing power rather than genuine passion, sacrifice, a sense of togetherness, trust, support, and tolerance for each other. We have started to view people as commodities that can be exchanged, consumed, and disposed of.
Moreover, falling in love has become some kind of window shopping where we look for different categories of image, expectation, satisfaction, and anticipation in someone to fall in love with, just like we go through a catalog to find a suitable product with essential features, functions, qualities, possibilities, and consumer benefits. As with other products, if it serves our purpose, our relationship will last for years; otherwise, it will be dumped and replaced if it fails to meet our expectations.
Besides, based on our consumer mindset, we think that we can easily dump a person and find a replacement rather than engage in the difficult tasks of acceptance, accommodations, and conflict resolution. After all, a loving relationship is interchangeable from the standpoint of a consumer; thus, like any rational consumer, we are free to dispose of the other person when we are confident enough to realize that we can now possess an upgraded model than what we currently have.
In the age of consumerism, our ways of loving and being in relationships also resemble how we would interact with and react to any other consumer product available on the market. Loving someone is just a part of consumer behavior.
Just as consumers have learned to seek temporary satisfaction—something attractive that immediately makes us happy for a moment—we all have become collectors of transient moments in love. Lovers may post their pictures or reveal their intimate confessions of love to the public in a manner of showing off, but lovers always feel insecure about being disposed of, dropped, or interchanged. And like our affection for any other consumer product, after a while, love also fades away.
Loving relationships have indeed become liquid.

Patan is a historical city situated in Lalitpur District of Nepal, inhabited by the people of Newar community. A remarkable characteristic of this city is its portrayal of religious harmony between Hindus and Buddhists in every aspect of the community. Being born and raised here, I got more and more interested in the city when I started doing my graduate studies in Urban Planning, and the insights have been truly fulfilling.
Sustainable cities are the pressing need of modern times. City planners use tactics such as zoning, open space allocation, walkability, urban growth boundaries, satellite cities and many more to achieve this, but the way in which the then planners of Patan achieved this is truly worth learning.
Let me take you through Patan in the 17th century. To start with, “Astamatrika”, the eight mother goddesses, and “Dashamahavidya”, the 10 goddesses, were established to set the boundary for urban expansion. The faith in these places of worship was such that people did not go beyond the perimeter set by the goddesses. This protected the lower fertile agricultural land, while the higher ground was used for settlement. So the perimeter boundary directed the development to be compact, and thus walkable. However, though there was compactness, there were ample urban open spaces and lung spaces (green spaces). Urban open spaces named “Lachi”, “Nani”, “Bahal” & “Bahi” were preserved and each was tied with its respective religious belief system (Hinduism or Buddhism), such that no one encroached upon it (unlike our open spaces!). For lung spaces named “khyo”, different festivals and socio-cultural events were planned such that the space would be in constant care. Also, open spaces of ecological importance were tied with various rituals too. The planners then had the vision and the creative methods to protect these open spaces.

Moving further into the city, the form of residential quarters shows the importance given to communal living. The houses are clustered around an inner courtyard, giving room for private spaces inside houses, while ensuring access to a larger public space for everyone. This model with slight deviations is becoming popular with Western developers too.

Newa Chen, a 17th-century building, renovated in 2006 with help from UNESCO

In the case of zoning, it was “zoning by jaat” or “zoning by profession”. Though the concept of “jaat” led to social discrimination, in those days it was primarily used to create “homogeneous communities by occupation” to create agglomeration and economies of scale. With all this in place, when the population still exceeded a certain limit, a satellite town was established with linkages to the main town, to curb the effects of overpopulation.
So this begs the question, how was this extraordinary feat made possible? Certainly, the planners were quite creative and the tool they used was ritual mediation. The meanings given by the people to these rituals had bound the people. They put tremendous faith in rituals and religion. But now, as with every historic city, Patan is going through the process of degeneration. At times the rituals can be seen to be performed only for the sake of rituals, without paying enough attention to the deeper purpose of sustainability, which they hoped to achieve. This situation has brought forth a new set of challenges, which calls for maximum creative efforts by planners to establish newer meanings. An example could be, the lung spaces mentioned earlier being protected through socio-cultural events might be adjusted by giving access to schools for their events in culture and sports, in case the previous ties grow weaker.
History serves as a record of experiences and learning, but not as a rule book. It is up to us to learn from the experiences of the past, and come up with creative solutions to tackle the challenges of the present and future.
May the planners of the future write as highly of us as we write about the planners of the past.

In a very odd manner, every possible world tends to exist in ways that are not entirely physical. A world that could be described in words but is devoid of any space-time convergence. Our dreams, for example, don't have any physical run-down. They just appear real to the dreamer and yet leave in a wisp when they are over. The dreamer then is left with the memory of the world that never gets to come alive, the world of zero substance, and the world whose absence is the very reason that gives meaning to the world that gets to live forward.
The nonappearance of every possible version of our other realities makes it possible for this reality to emanate into the physical world that matters to us the most. This is where we find ourselves. This is the one that has its claim on us. Think about the person you didn’t marry, the child that wasn’t born to you, the winter that failed to bring the snow and the friendship that couldn’t find its morning in the dew of little things and didn’t get refreshed.
In that sense, all that didn’t happen in a life is the very life blood of what did happen in a very bizarre and asymmetrical manner. The relationship between those two worlds is just the fringe line that makes those two worlds mutually coeval. Not just the one that claims me but also the one that I am absent from. 
This is the world that I ponder about all the time. This is also where I find myself present in my absence. 
Those two roads that diverged in the woods and the one Robert Frost didn’t take, 
What happened to that road? 
Did it wither away? 
Or did it somehow become a critical part of the one that was taken? Frost’s grievance about the road not taken makes one wonder what the real loss to him was. 
The road that he didn’t take is as necessary as the one he did take. 
For if it were not for the one untaken, the taken would lose its significance. 
However, unlike Robert Frost, there are moments in life where two roads don’t always diverge into the yellow wood. In fact, I only see one road ahead of me. And this one doesn’t lead to the yellow wood. Instead, it leads to this huge strip of a green hill. In the midst of that hill, there’s a big oak tree. Under it, I see a man waiting for something, or perhaps someone. I don’t know.
So, I hesitate for a moment, but then I move toward him to get closer.
The story of his life is the story of anyone’s life. He has had his share of life’s ups and downs in this world that claims him in all its hue and tinge. The man’s loss of his love, his aspirations, his honor, his will, and all that makes him the hero of his device, all that is taken away. 
This is the man who doesn’t look straight at me. I cannot clearly see him.
His voice grooved and barely audible, as if he is telling the story of his life to himself. My presence doesn't seem to bother him. He is speaking very softly, and he is speaking of the life he missed to be a part of. This life, the one under the oak, isn’t his for him. He is a stranger here.
The life, he thinks, belongs to him is in the negative space. It is the space that can only be imagined or dreamed of. This is where he finds his completions. 
His love, his honor, his aspirations, and everything that makes him a whole, it happens in this imagined space.
This is his home, the one built on his absences.
Nonetheless, he seems not to understand that both these worlds, the one under the oak tree and the one away from it are his to claim.
One subdued in the background while the other bulged out into physical space. 
Both these two realms are necessary for this forlorn man to become a whole.
Take away one and the other ceases to live. 
I look at him again, and this time, he looks right back at me.
The man slowly moves as if to talk to me. He leans forward.
Now, I see his face in my deepest awe. I know this man! 
This is the man from that hill. The man from under the oak tree.
I recognize him now. This man is me. 
I am the man under that oak tree.

I can understand when philosopher Slavoj Zizek sees happiness as unethical. For many of us happiness seekers, his assertion may sound rather surprising. However, I think Zizek is right with his claim, if our appetite for maximizing our happiness now impacts ecological collapse, puts the existence of future generations on this planet at a greater risk and also compromises the ability of the future generations to meet their needs without strife and needless sufferings. Besides, in an age of hyperconsumerism, we have placed our habits of happiness on a shallow myth that we can’t be happy without having. And, we have mindlessly decided to overlook the bitter truth that many of our happiness choices are detrimental to the ecology and sustainability. Similarly, our search for happiness can be unethical if we stifle and undermine the happiness of others for our selfish fulfillments. We see this in our family life, where most parents add needless sorrows in the lives of their children for not keeping up with their choices, expectations and preferences.
My own search for happiness reminds me that the road I am traveling on is full of potholes. And, by traveling on this bumpy road, I have realized that happiness always appears in our life in unusual shapes, sounds and sizes. Hence, there are little puddles of humor, fun, playfulness and joys everywhere. Moreover, in my search for happiness, I have unearthed some essential ingredients for a happy life.
To live a happy life, firstly, we need to respect and admire others for their unique ways of being in the world. Some like to make noise, others crave silence, and some like to be in front and others like to shout from the back. Hence, rather than comparing people, we need to admire people for who they are, what they have been through and how they like to engage with other people. With this respect we can both increase and improve our human relationships, the way we relate to each other, which is essential for a happy life.
The next ingredient for a happy life is that we need to have enough courage so that we can avoid becoming a chasing shadow of other people’s expectations, projections and desires. Without courage, our life would be nothing more than a tedious circle of compulsions and compromises. And, it also takes enormous courage to be satisfied with who we are and what we have right now.
Finally, so much of our happiness depends on our ability to let go of our sense of control. In a world of imperfections, how our life unfolds and how people decide to act and react with us are beyond our absolute control. Hence, rather than holding onto the ropes of our expectations tightly, we need to let go and enjoy what remains of it, the experience of life, with all its random surprises - and that’s what happiness is.
Sources of Happiness
The most important source of happiness in our life is not what we have with us or what we want to have sooner or later, rather, streams of happiness begin to sprout in our life abundantly when we begin to realize that our human life is indeed little and we can’t go on postponing our happiness by attaching it to some event, situation or to an achievement that we may never encounter in our short life. None of us have a written script of our life with us and as we strive toward our dreams and possibilities, often the drama of life turns out the way we never suspected.
And, to find happiness in those messy and confusing moments of our life we need to recognize that patterns of human life are unwritten, uncalled for and unpredictable. Even with our utmost preparedness none of us can systematically dictate the course of our life with our own will. Therefore, in order to live a happy life we need to replace the concept of happiness as a destination with the concept of happiness as a process. After all, so much of the happiness we experience in our life depends on how we react to what is happening in and around us.
Most of us are unhappy because we think of happiness in terms of when or how we are going to be happy. Whereas we can create happiness even in difficult situations of our life by remaining resolute in our inner conviction that with whatever we have we can always recreate our life once again. Besides, when we have nothing else to do, even counting what we already have also makes us happy. Despite having many things, many of us are miserable with a single thought of why we don’t have with us what the rest of the world already has.
Having is not enough; happiness happens when we do something that makes us feel worthwhile, energetic, focused, connected, purposeful and engaged. For example, we can learn new stuff, develop new habits, cultivate new friends, make life easy for ourselves, let go of expectations that pull us down and sometimes take a step back to see things anew. Moreover, life is not fair and all of us don’t need equal things to be equally happy. Our struggles also give us a sense of happiness when we realize that we are maturing as a human being climbing new heights.
Finally, I feel that the most precious source of happiness is always cheap, ordinary, plentiful, spontaneous and free. Just the other day, I was witnessing clouds in the sky, which seemed like building tiny steps into eternity, and these clouds floating in the sky made me feel relaxed and fulfilled for a while. I know there is nothing special about clouds playing in the sky. However, all we get in life are the moments to become happy and it depends on how we add these moments  to our experiences and make our life a satisfying journey.
Happiness: A Journey
Whenever I ponder over my quest for a flourishing life, I take the words of poet T.S. Elliot rather seriously as he has written somewhere in one of his poems that, we shall not cease from exploration/and the end of all our exploring/we will arrive where we started and know the place for the first time. In essence, our search for happiness begins with oneself and culminates within oneself. However, in a world of constant distractions, denials, self-deceptions and delusions, for most of us it is rather discomforting to be at ease, comfort or at peace with oneself.
After witnessing and experiencing various ups and downs in our life and facing up to all the troubles and sorrows that life throws at us from time to time, our search for happiness turns full circle when we realize that the ultimate joy in our life begins to overflow profoundly when we become true to ourselves standing before the mirror of our life, embracing its true reflections and finding freedom within our self. But, the paradox here is that only those who know how to spread out their self find happiness within them. Hence, in our search for happiness we also realize that happiness is not something we experience in isolation and that we derive most of our happiness by connecting with people around us.
Moreover, the journey of life takes its own turn and we also need to adopt, adjust and add a sense of growth and maturity with our age as various phases of our life have their own peculiar sources of joy for us to rediscover. Here, for many people their search for happiness becomes delusional, self-destructive and indulgent, when they fail to comprehend this reality of human life. Hence, to experience happiness at different junctures, we need to rephrase and reshape our dreams, hopes, wishes, relationships and expectations, adopting the emerging realities of our life. Besides, as long as we are pursuing happiness, our search becomes like running about from one circle to another trying to find something that exists like a mirage appearing in the dry wilderness; it appears at once and escapes in another moment. And, while journeying on rough and tough roads of our life in search of happiness, often we need to take a pause and shift our mind from the loops of desiring and expecting to life itself where everything is alive and happening.
Lastly, rather than finding, happiness is just about letting go and losing oneself in the moment with whatever ordinary we have, a piece of music, art, dance, reflection, love, friendship, conversation, meditation , sex, fun or poetry. After all, happiness is always with us, it simply needs a bit of inner tuning and with our sense of ease, acceptance and comfort within oneself, we can catch its vibrations all around us echoing.

Rabindra Mishra’s new alliance with the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party, virtually a political arm of the former king, has hogged much of the limelight in recent days. The comfort with which he has gelled with his new companions indicates that Mishra is much more at ease under the former king’s patronage than he ever was during his brief, if half-hearted, stint as a republican with the Bibeksheel Sajha Party. The palpable ease with which he has hugged the institution of monarchy shows that he has finally sloughed off his outer skin and has decided to openly and unequivocally put the money where his mouth is. In deciding to abandon his previous niceties–both in his ideology as well as his speech–Mishra has replaced his finger wagging schoolmarmish style, with a metaphorical sledge-hammer and has decided to wield it against the nascent democracy questioning its very foundations.
It is no wonder that Mishra has tapped into a powerful mix of grievances and resentment of the old guard, those who typically were the beneficiaries of–and did well under–the former king’s and his predecessor’s patronage. If the “likes” and “retweets” on Twitter are any indication, even those who claim to be a “Global Citizen from Gulmi” seem to be tacitly endorsing a patently parochial view based on medieval superstitions.
That a child born in a certain family inherently holds a superior position to the rest of us and accordingly has an in-born right to rule as an “enlightened guardian”–something that Mishra is advocating for–is a notion that would invoke laughter and ridicule if it was not so dangerous and foolish.
Now, to his credit, I think Mishra is indirectly and unwittingly serving democracy by holding the banner of opposition against, among other things, the cronyism and kleptocracy of our current leaders. The current crop of leaders are indeed undermining Nepal’s fledgling democracy by their own incompetence and widespread grift. Our democratic institutions, unfortunately, have not matured enough to curb the excesses of our leaders and a sensible conservatism, I believe, does have an important role to play in the current political climate.
However, by advocating for the resurrection of a dated institution that has been the provenance of bigotry, arbitrary hierarchy, and authoritarian policies in the past, Mishra is doing nothing more than expressing his frustration against the radical leveling of human dignity that has followed the Maoist Revolution in Nepal.
For all its chaos and cravenness, there is no denying that the Maoist revolution initiated an era of modernity that valued the minorities and indigenous people as human beings with their own individuality and human dignity, something that was denied to them for centuries under the structural discriminations created and sustained under various monarchical regimes.
Mishra’s belief that a “soft dictator” should always hover over the heads of Nepali people–ready to unleash the punitive power of the state at its will–not only belies ignorance of human psychology and its cravings for unlimited power, but, more importantly, is indicative of a limited historical understanding of how democracy functions and delivers.
Democracy, though a rule of the majority, ensures fundamental freedoms and protects the rights of the minorities. It is an inherently messy system which by default favors wheeling and dealing among various political actors instead of dealing in quick fixes along clean and defined lines. Unfortunately the bad tags along with the good in a democracy, and it is one of the vital duties of a politician to see that the good comes out on top. However, men are not angels and therefore democracy requires institutional maturity and independence to hold the political actors accountable whenever they cross the legal and normative boundaries. And those boundaries are set not only by courts and government agencies but also by the society at large. An intelligent politician more attuned to the aspirations of modern times would try to align our Byzantine institutions–the actual root of our current problem–with the promises enshrined in our current Constitution, however lacking those may be. It is no doubt easier said than done; however, a great leader knows that not everything can be achieved in one’s lifetime. A good leader knows that our present should not define our future because politics at heart is about what ought to be rather than what is.
Instead Mishra has decided to provoke the latent elements in our society that are atavistic, backward, and superstitious. By surrendering his conscience at the altar of His Highness, Mishra, I believe, is doing a disservice to the ideology of conservatism itself. In his interviews he regularly waxes nostalgic about what we have lost as a culture and community, but rarely does he acknowledge what we have gained as a nation. The laundry list of his complaints are long and consist mainly of the natural consequences that result when a society long held on a chokehold of arbitrary power breaks free. The Nepali people have freed themselves from an arbitrary power that could snatch our freedom at will. We have laid the groundwork for a positive, scientific, and a forward looking country where the minorities and the indigenous have an equal ownership in the nation. It would be a significant backward step to take that away from the people and hand it over to a hereditary power that could potentially pull the plug on our democracy on its whim. Are we really up for that?

What does the future of humanity look like? Machine learning and artificial intelligence are pushing all kinds of business, innovation, research and other areas to a whole new level, especially in developed countries. The time has come for Nepal to embrace the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to tackle the difficult problems that the country has faced for centuries. Natural disasters, precision agriculture, managing road traffic, environmental sustainability are the perfect candidates for the next technological revolutions.
As a middle school student in America, I have had the privilege of learning programming and machine learning along with theoretical foundations from experts in the field. I invite the girls of Nepal to join me in learning the foundations of data science and machine learning so that we not only help the country to grow with a future army of machine learning experts, but also smooth out the wrinkles of the gender gap in Nepal. It is obvious that one of the most significant steps toward breaking the gender barrier is through empowering girls. Let's make it happen!
Your future is powered by code; if you want to build for the future, you'll need to learn how to code. Here, I propose an innovative idea about the most sophisticated tool that is transforming the world right now. I invite the girls of Nepal to join me in learning how to code for predictive analytics and machine learning. My purpose for this call is twofold: first, to contribute to reducing the gender gap, and second, to have fun teaching coding and machine learning.
Coding, or computer programming, is a vital tool in science, engineering, business and many other fields that will help you tremendously in achieving your goals. Coding is the language of machine learning and predictive analytics. The developed countries of the world are undergoing a major transformation in their economies thanks to the very powerful algorithms of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). But how does it work?
Machine learning is a futuristic idea that has been in the making for quite some time now. It is a set of algorithms that predicts patterns and data on a large scale. Machines are learning how to process vast amounts of data in order to improve our lives in ways we can't even fathom. Machine learning is a set of computer algorithms that learn how to make predictions based on the information provided. With human intelligence, it is difficult to make predictions with datasets that are too large, complex, or vast. In contrast, machines will be able to take the data and make the predictions that humans cannot.
Take an example of AlphaGo with which began the global sensation of AI. Designed in 2015, AlphaGo, an AI with unimaginable power, won against the best of the best in the game of Go. The best part is, the designer of AlphaGo has no clue how to play the game.
Whereas AlphaGo is an example of a full-blown powerful AI, what I am proposing here is the route to becoming a specialist in various types of predictive analytics and machine learning. Conventionally, AI has been treated as a broad spectrum of techniques that solve a computational task. This can theoretically include many techniques, many of them being not-so-great historically. Machine learning is a suite of powerful statistical models and algorithms that have developed dramatically in these last few decades. These days, when the media talks about AI, they usually refer to a specific version of the ML models called deep learning or its variants.
Machine learning is a remarkable set of technologies that can be used for a wide variety of applications. One of the algorithms I’ve written is 97% accurate in detecting breast cancer. For this, I used a database of over 11,000 medical records published online. The model I wrote learns to distinguish a case of breast cancer from a healthy breast by comparing many characteristics of breasts afflicted with cancer versus the ones without. Machine learning is the foundation of the future of healthcare. Experts believe that half of the medical discoveries and innovations will come from machine learning in a decade, as opposed to the current heavy reliance on hard-core scientific research as of now.
Machine learning algorithms are used for many kinds of applications such as in healthcare, email filtering, speech recognition, computer vision, search engine queries, and many more. The question is, can we create an army of ML experts in Nepal and make a dent in the gender gap with the proper training and mindset?
Machine learning, specifically AI driven by the architecture of deep learning model, is transforming the industries of the developed world. Whereas all these achievements sound far-fetched, especially in a developing country like Nepal, they were all achieved with the application of powerful algorithms. For that, all you need is a passion to learn how to code and to learn the theory. I am myself learning machine learning, and have already been able to use some of the machine learning models I have programmed in various predictions. It gives me pleasure when I can teach what I have learnt and help reduce the gender gap at the same time. If you are curious about coding, data engineering and machine learning, join me online in gaining this new knowledge.
In this programming and machine learning course, I will walk you through the basics of programming. This foundational material about scripting is the first step in programming of any type of analytics. And this is going to enrich you with a whole new suite of scripts to perform many essential tasks in analytics. The skills in foundational programming will also come handy when you want to solve many kinds of real-world problems. For example, I like to program and solve problems that come up in college-level probability courses. I am able to do this via programming even when I don’t understand the math.
I have created a few articles showing several of these problems, their code, and solutions. For example, roll several dice at the same time and if you observe the same number in more than one dice repeatedly, those outcomes can be simulated with the code I published here. In another article here, I show how the chances of two students in a group of 25 having the birthday on the same day are actually pretty high. I have also published my code here to find the probabilities of various kinds of card games. In addition, I simulated the famed Monty Hall Problem to solve the puzzling question as to which choice would help you win the game. The simulation of the situation [available at my GitHub] revealed that the answer was not what I had thought.
Whereas you can do many types of problem-solving with the basics of programming like I showed above, the main goal of this first course is to get ready for machine learning. Once the basics of programming are completed, I will walk you through several models of machine learning. If you are interested, sign up today for this free course. All you need is a computer, and the desire to learn!

I come from the Chepang community, one of the most backward communities in Nepal and categorized as a highly marginalized community by the National Federation for Development of Indigenous Nationalities (NFDIN). As I belong to and grew up in this community, it motivated me to write a reflective piece on the contributions of education and the bottlenecks for the Chepang community in the current educational pedagogy in Nepal.
The Chepang community falls behind in different socioeconomic indicators such as literacy and access to health and basic infrastructure, as well as in different socioeconomic categorizations. Despite support from several NGOs, INGOs and constant support from the government, the Chepang community continues to remain in a dire situation. There were several non-formal education programs conducted by NGOs which have enabled target groups to become aware so that they can help themselves. Despite the continuous flow of aid, however, the desired socio-economic transformation has not been seen in the Chepang community. This gives ample supporting statement on why there has been less development in the Chepang community. Literacy rate is still low, most of them still live below the poverty line, and they are far behind in the human development index and similar indicators. There are indigenous communities who made a leap in income-generating activities, adult literacy programs, and other development activities. Chepang people, however, still lag behind on all fronts.
Every year thousands of students complete SEE, higher secondary education or bachelor’s degree out of whom few are from the Chepang community. Despite structural and historical disadvantages, a few Chepangs excel in their academic career. Even after Chepangs are able to complete their education in spite of several hardships, they need to compete with others for Public Service Commission, non-governmental, skills-based and other jobs. Those who are able to receive good schooling are at least exposed to multiple facilities including access to computer learning, libraries and sports, and so might have enriched their general knowledge and have a competitive advantage when applying for jobs. But the ones like students from the Chepang community who mostly complete school from a place where there are limited facilities, exposure and training, find it difficult to compete with the batch of students with whom they pass SEE or high school together. Lack of basic computer skills, training and exposure puts them at a disadvantage in the application process. However, there are a few exceptions where a student who completed schooling from a remote part of the country competed and excelled in many aspects. This gives ample space to reflect on what is holding the Chepang community back – whether it is the current pedagogy or the incompetency within students from the Chepang community.

Education as a means to reproduce inequality for Chepang community
It is clearly seen in Nepal that those who can afford expensive tuition fees, mostly those from economically well-off backgrounds, tend to send their children to private schools, colleges and universities because they think that expensive schools provide quality education.
When selecting schools and colleges for their children, parents with fat wallets in Nepal take into account the infrastructure of the institution, well-decorated classrooms, transportation, computer labs, swimming pools, basketball courts, football grounds and other facilities. These parents believe that quality education is provided by such schools with proper infrastructure and other facilities. Although it might be a subjective measurement for quality education as indicators, this will make a substantial impact on what students will learn in what environment. Though these may not be good indicators for measurement, what students will learn and how they will learn will certainly make an impact on the overall learning process. And yes, it is certain that students from better economic backgrounds can afford private tutors and attend private schools. Several studies have also found out the positive relations between students’ economic backgrounds and their test scores. These components contribute to differential academic performance in schools which is directly related to the income of a student’s family.
The Chepangs, most of whom come from a poor and downtrodden socioeconomic background, cannot generally attend expensive schools unless they are provided scholarships, subsidies and other benefits. So, students from affluent families go to well-off schools while those from poor economic background attend economic schools. These are the initial indicators for students leading to learning disparities that reinforce social inequality. These substantiate that schools provide competitive learning environments to advantaged children compared to disadvantaged children where schools reproduce or exacerbate some inequalities.
To illustrate with a real-life example, I asked my sister Simran Praja (name changed) who is waiting for her grade 12 results. She is not familiar with what a CV or resume is. She also does not have computer knowledge and skills which are a prerequisite in today’s job market. Basic email communication, searching for jobs, applying for jobs and getting shortlisted is a tall order. There are only a handful of Chepang representatives in government services. Hence, preparing for Public Service Commission jobs is also a difficult task although it’s not impossible.
Hence, these real-life examples clearly show the challenges faced by Chepang students even after they manage to complete basic schooling, high school and even university education. The quality of education that Chepang students are getting is leading them nowhere. A research on Chepangs in 2011 found out that Chepangs had more access to education than before, but the quality of education that Chepang students were receiving was below average. Though a growing number of students were enrolled in schools, children were now just going through the rituals of schooling rather than learning and preparing for their secure future.

Educational journey stymies Chepang’s development
Reflecting on my personal experience of growing up in a Chepang community where there is material deprivation, lack of fulfillment of basic needs and other necessities further deprives the Chepang students of a learning environment. Several studies claim that material deprivation also leads to low educational achievement in schools as students coming from low economic strata tend to lack education materials, environment and parental guidance throughout. To illustrate with an example, poverty plays a crucial role in Chepang children dropping out of school. Some may not be able to afford an education while some drop out in the middle due to household responsibilities. To support the claim one study states that cultural factors play a significant role in Chepang girls dropping out of school as Chepang people expect girls to help their families with household chores, leaving many girls at home during the harvest season and festivals when their families need their help. The author claims that many girls do not attend classes on a regular basis because of household duties such as cutting grass for animals, cooking food, cleaning and taking care of younger siblings.
Even during the recent COVID crisis in Nepal, several students from poor economic backgrounds could not afford to purchase phones and internet data packs which hampered their class attendance. As a result, they could not attend online classes in schools, ultimately leading to many school dropouts in the last two years. Most of the school-going children from the Chepang community had to discontinue their education during the pandemic for lack of internet access, technology and devices, resulting in a large number of dropouts.
These reflections and arguments are also backed up by contributions in sociology by scholars such as Luis Althusur, Downey and Condron who claim that education acts as a means for reproduction of ruling class ideology where dominant class ideology is taught. The scholarly claims that schools act as engines of inequality dominate contemporary sociology of education even though schools play little role in generating achievement gaps. These educational institutions act as a social sorting machine, creating categories that serve as the foundation of later life inequalities. These categories contribute to production of inequalities within schools and beyond.
Way forward for Chepangs: Technical education as a ray of hope
Development agencies still tend to impose their own agenda rather than fulfilling the requirements of Chepangs. Some of the common instances are awareness activities such as financial frugality, use of contraceptives, use of pit latrine, growing cash crops, forming mothers groups, training on tailoring, youth clubs, and ability to sign one’s name. Where is the indigenous knowledge and the prior knowledge that the Chepang community possesses? Why did income-based learning not become a priority for this vulnerable and poor community? Technical and vocational education is gradually gaining popularity in the Chepang community. Technical certified jobs like staff nurse, overseer, electrician, plumber, health assistant are now becoming a way forward for the Chepang community. There are growing numbers of staff nurses who are already in local level health posts on government contracts. These small steps also play a key role in helping the Chepang community support their families, siblings in accessing education and other opportunities.
As most of the Chepang people are below the poverty line, the government needs to give priority to creating more employment opportunities so that everyone can get work. Given that a majority of youths from the community are less educated and have dropped out halfway through school, the country needs to train and mobilize them in the development process. Productivity-focused training skills, recognizing prior learning of Chepangs should be imparted with inclusive targeting to the Chepang community which can provide access to work. This entire process not only helps the country’s economy to grow but also enables the Chepang youths to earn their livelihoods.

As I sit by my ailing father, I have an impression of him representing an era of slowly vanishing Limbu culture and tradition of Mundhum-based rites and rituals.
I still vividly remember how vehemently he performed the ritual of Tongsing Takma as a Yeba (Limbu shaman assigned for carrying out various rituals) some decades ago. In the night of the ritual performance, he would wear long white robe tightened at the waist, a headdress decorated with the feathers of different birds and garlands made from the beads of rudraksha. For the whole night, he would recite Mundhum and dance around the bamboo pole known as Yagesing fixed for the ritual in the middle of the courtyard. As a boy, I could hardly grasp the eloquence of his Mundhum recitation and message of those rich oral scriptures. For me, the event was simply an occasion of celebration and fun where I enjoyed ludicrously following and copying his dancing steps and panicked and thrilled being chased by him in the middle of the ritual performance along with others.
Back then, Limbu community operated differently. They observed their own distinct life rituals including Tongsing Takma. The night of Tongsing Takma was not only an event for ritual performance but it was also a social gathering for the entire villagers. Some of them would come to join hands for the different responsibilities including feeding Tongba (millet beer served in a wooden barrel shaped vessel) and other local liquor to the visitors while others would come to know their fortune from the words of the Yeba, my father. Others joined the Yeba and his Yagapsiba (assistant of the Yeba) in the ritual dance carrying and beating brass plates. For majority of villagers, it was a pure form of an entertainment free of invitation. Everyone was welcomed in the night of the Tongsing Takma ritual.
The decade of 1990 ushered prodigious changes in Nepali politics as well as in sociocultural realms. The Janaandolan of 1990 saw an end of absolute monarchy replaced by constitutional monarchy and multiparty system ending three decades of party-less Panchayat system imposed by King Mahendra in 1960. The same decade also worked as a harbinger for the country embracing neoliberal ideals as the panacea for socio-economical transformation. Nobody thought of far-reaching implications of the incipient systems to the local language, culture, knowledge system and social structures of the indigenous people.
Same applied to the Limbu people, chiefly inhabiting the eastern part of Nepal.  In addition to joining British and Indian armies as Lahure, many Limbu youths followed the footsteps of other Nepali migrant workers making destinations mainly to Malaysia and the Gulf Cooperative Council countries including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait among others. As foreign employment became a major source of income for many a Nepali households in the last three decades, it further provided an impetus for people to migrate from the hills and mountains to the plain regions of Tarai and from rural villages to city and towns, thus bringing unprecedented changes in rubrics of society and culture.
Such migration trends not only resulted in the shortage of working age people in the villages but also brought changes in demographic and economic structures of towns and countryside leaving the family members of migrant workers increasingly dependent on the remittance they send from abroad. Accordingly, people fell under the charm of consumerism ultimately debilitating the bonds of social relationship and cultural convictions of the indigenous people. As everybody seemed lost in the reservoirs of containment by hailing the contribution of Nepali migrant workers to the economic development of Nepal, nobody seemed cognizant of the disconcerting side of the coin, the breakdown in the family structures and cultural mosaics. The void was not only created in the local labor markets, but also in the urgency of indigenous cultural behaviors and ritual practices.
In the past, my father used to remain busy throughout the year serving the village households as Yeba, performing different rituals of Limbu community like Sappok Chomen (ritual for womb worshipping prior to birth), Mangenna (ritual for good health, peace and progress), Mekkhim (ritual for marriage ceremony) etc. Due to his engagement in such activities of the community, I sometimes used to hear him complaining about not having time for his own household chores as a farmer. But he readily served the community on such occasions. I still remember how my father used to take pride in his narratives of being kidnapped by a supernatural wild shaman in his childhood who taught him the sacred knowledge of Mundhum and turned himself a self learnt Yeba, as one of the chosen persons by the God to save Limbu community from the various misfortunes and sickness. Gradually, my father and fellow Limbu shamans commonly called as Phedangma, Samba, Yeba and Yuma not only found their roles being drastically limited within the community, but they also failed to pass their knowledge to the next generation.
Hermeneutics of Tongsing Mundhum
According to Mundhum scholar Bairagi Kaila, Tongsing Mundhum is an extreme expression of social, ethical and religious beliefs of Limbu people. He writes in Tongsing Takma Mundhum: Aakhyan Ra Anusthan (Tongsing Takma Mundhum: Narratives and Rituals) that Tongsing Mundhum is a quintessential collection of oral literature and ethnic narratives that have been transferred orally from the time immemorial to the Limbu people. This Mundhum is recited and narrated along with music of brass plates and drums by Limbu shamans known as Samba, Yeba, and Yema during the performances of Tongsing Takma ritual. It is believed that Tongsing Mundhum was originated long before the art of writing was introduced.
According to scholar Chaintanya Subba, various myths, legends, narratives and oracles have been incorporated in Tongsing Mundhum which guide the social, ethical and religious concepts and shape the attitude and behavior of the Limbus. It consists of the various myths related to the origin of universe, human beings, plants and animals, and birth of the concepts of incest, jealousy, curse etc. in human society and the remedies for different problems in the society.
Limbus believe that there have been substantial influences of the Tongsing Mundhum in the customs, ideologies, moral values and life rituals of the Limbu community. It has a distinct pragmatic and instructional value with regards to the construction and continuation of various social practices and belief system in the Limbu community. It has played a crucial role in imparting the message of social solidarity and cooperation. However, there remains an effectual task for us to explore the social dimensions of Tongsing Takma ritual impacting the social life and practices of Limbus in the past.
Modernization has resulted into an irreversible loss of Limbu cultural heritages and ritual practices. A handful of enthusiasts of Limbu community are in disagreement themselves on which terminology best describes Limbu religion and cultural landscapes. Each group claims its own validity over the other but ironically overlooks the urgency of passing the knowledge to the coming generation. They don’t realize that culture and rituals live in society, not in institutions and books. If such cultural values can not be transferred to the coming generation, they would be the matter of history, to be searched in anthologies and museums. We certainly do not want that. So, rather than castigating others, we need to explore the nostrums to address the present challenges.
As the majority of young generation are detached from such ritual practices, an irreparable cultural void is being created every day. Incipient danger is that present generation could be the last generation of Limbu community practicing and living with the distinct cultural practices and Mundhum-based life rituals. As remaining Phedangma, Samba, Yeba and Yuma have failed to transfer their knowledge to the young generation, it would be very hard to find their disciples practicing these rituals through the oral recitation of Mundhum after one or two decades. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t want this to happen either. But I have not seen any other possibility too until we carry the torch of responsibility to stand as bulwarks to protect and preserve our distinctive cultural traits before they are pushed into oblivion by the varieties of intrusions.
Today, Tongsing Takma and other rituals have become rare events in Limbu community due to two main reasons: first, very few Limbu Phedangma, Samba, Yeba, and Yema are left in the community who can perform them in a proper way and second, young generation have no inclination to follow these rituals as they are gradually losing interest in the past ideals. This is not simply the fault of young generation living under the overwhelming fluctuations of information and technology. We must take responsibility for not infusing them cultural consciousness and not persuading them to adopt these value systems in everyday life.
Nowadays, a very few households are conducting Tongsing Takma and other rituals as a part of their daily lives mostly in remote villages. Some enthusiastic individuals and institutions are conducting this ritual in Kathmandu and other towns too. But such events largely become a simulacrum of the real Tongsing Takma, more as a frail attempt to recreate it and less as a distinct life rituals of the Limbu community. Such formalized occasions cannot persuade the heuristic value of these rituals to the coming generations.
The only positive sign in this area is there have been some works in the transcribing the oral scriptures of Mundhum recited by those Limbu shamans. In recent days, some Limbu scholars and writers have transcribed Mundhum in Limbu and Nepali language and have documented those ritual performances. In this direction, the colossus work of Mundhum expert Bairagi Kaila is always commendable. He has collected and transcribed most of the Mundhum with the help of Limbu Phedangma, Samba, Yeba, and Yema. I personally feel indebted to his huge contribution to the Limbu community by preserving Limbu Mundhum.
Years ago, in the night of the Tongsing Takma ritual, my father used to recite Mundhum and its myths in a rhythmic tone from his infallible memory followed by rhythmic beating of his brass plate and harmonious shamanic dancing steps. In the morning, he would perform the ritual of Silam Sakma (blocking the path of death) for the whole family concerned by reciting the Mundhum as:
A bright place due to the moon above us
A bright place due to the sun above us
In the place of life and age 
Are life and age decreasing?
Are the bells of time and death ringing?
Now, without letting the death bell ring
I toss this incanted coin 
To block the path of the death.
(Excerpts translated from the Tongsing Takma Mundhum: Aakhyan Ra Anusthan by Bairagi Kaila)
With these words, he would toss the coin in the name of each family member until the intended side of the coin overturned in the ground. The turning of the expected side of the coin is believed to have blocked the path of death, as a part of the ritual. I do not claim the efficacy of this ritual in the real time, but the psychological and mental asset of such rituals were certainly an important part of the community in past.
Once ardent practitioner of Mundhum based rituals, my father would spend hours discussing about Mundhum and its various myths deciphering their meaning and implications to us. He adored Mundhum as a treasure for Limbu community that teaches us to live in harmony with nature. He used to say all natural entities be it rivers, hills, caves, forests, or anything that we get from nature, have to be worshiped and preserved because they support human life in one way or the other. He was not being philosophical at that time, neither had he had any idea of the subject but he was simply passing his impression of Mundhum for our generation. Today, I feel that humankind have already deferred the deadline to respect the nature, by exploiting its resources to the fullest extent and wreaking an unprecedented havoc in its beauty. And obviously, we are getting paid by the effects of global warming and other disastrous natural phenomena for our irresponsible action towards nature threatening the existence of life in the blue planet.
Even though we listened to his stories enthusiastically, my father could figure out that his listeners were losing interests in them. Then his remarks would be same as always - time has changed…in our time………and so on. At this moment, I can sense the meaning of his words but the time has changed for me too. But what I fear most is I even may not have the same words to convey to my children by referring to the nostalgia of our time. The indispensable cultural values that ​​we have inherited from our ancestors have been eroding with the passage of time. We are living in an age of cultural deviation and oblivion. Now, when I sit by my ailing father living in his early eighties, I sometimes envisage him as Truganini (1812 –1876) the last full blood Aboriginal Tasmanian, whose culture and identity were completely swept away by the wave of 19th century colonialism.

French President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday that France and its allies could have stopped the 1994 Rwanda genocide but lacked the will to do so, a strong declaration ahead of the African country’s 30th anniversary of the slaughter that left over 800,000 people dead.
Macron’s office said in a statement that the French president will release a video on social media on Sunday as Rwanda marks the solemn commemoration of the genocide.
In the video, Macron says that “France, which could have stopped the genocide with its Western and African allies, lacked the will to do so.”
In 2021 during a visit to the central African country, Macron acknowledged France’s “responsibility” in the genocide that left over 800,000 people dead, mainly ethnic Tutsis and the Hutus who tried to protect them.
He stopped short of an apology, but Rwandan President Paul Kagame signaled that a page had been turned in France-Rwanda ties, following a series of French efforts to repair ties between the two countries.
The Rwandan government has long accused France of “enabling” the genocide.
Since he was first elected in 2017, Macron notably commissioned a report about France’s role before and during the genocide and decided to open the country’s archives from this period to the public.
In Sunday’s video, Macron will recall that when the genocide started, “the international community had the means to know and to take actions” based on the knowledge about genocides that had been revealed by survivors of the Armenian genocide and the Holocaust, his office said.
Macron will reaffirm that “France stands by Rwanda and the Rwandan people, in memory of the one million children, women and men martyred because they were born Tutsi,” according to his office.
Macron’s office said France will be represented by Foreign Minister Stéphane Séjourné at the commemoration of the genocide scheduled on Sunday in Kigali, the French president himself being held back in France by World War II commemorations that day.
In recent years, France has also increased efforts to arrest genocide suspects and send them to trial.
A Rwandan doctor was sentenced in December by a Paris court to 24 years in prison in what was the sixth case related to the Rwandan genocide that came to court in France, all of them in the past decade.

French President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday that France and its allies could have stopped the 1994 Rwanda genocide but lacked the will to do so, a strong declaration ahead of the African country’s 30th anniversary of the slaughter that left over 800,000 people dead.
Macron’s office said in a statement that the French president will release a video on social media on Sunday as Rwanda marks the solemn commemoration of the genocide.

Israel says it’s taking steps to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, including reopening a key border crossing into northern Gaza.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced the plans Friday, hours after US President Joe Biden told him that future U.S. support for the war in Gaza depends on Israel taking more action to protect civilians and aid workers. The announcement did not elaborate on quantities or types of items to be let in.
Still, despite their differences, the Biden administration has continued to provide Israel crucial military aid and diplomatic support for Israel’s six-month war against Hamas. Israel faces growing international isolation after its forces killed seven aid workers helping deliver food in Gaza.
The Palestinian death toll has passed 33,000, with another 75,600 people wounded, Gaza’s Health Ministry said. The ministry doesn’t differentiate between civilians and combatants in its tally, but says women and children make up two-thirds of the dead.
The United Nations says much of the population in northern Gaza is on the brink of starvation. The top United Nations court has concluded there is a “plausible risk of genocide” in Gaza — a charge Israel strongly denies — and the U.N. Security Council has issued a legally binding demand for a cease-fire.
The war began Oct. 7, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage.

Donald Trump left the White House facing a cash crunch and a tattered reputation after his attempts to overturn the 2020 election, threatening the viability of his business empire. Soon, though, a new source stepped forward to provide a financial lifeline when many longtime lenders refused.
Over the past two years, Axos Bank, as well as its largest individual shareholder, California billionaire Don Hankey, have collectively extended more than $500 million in financing that has benefited Trump, records show. The cash influx has helped Trump to pay off debts and pocket a tidy profit while escaping from a lease on his money-losing former hotel in Washington.
It also covered a $175 million down payment he made this week on an eye-popping civil fraud penalty.
Axos Bank officials as well as Hankey have said that the deals offer them a financial upside.
But as Trump again pursues the White House, ethics and legal experts question what the lenders may ask in return if there’s a future Trump presidency, considering even small regulatory changes can translate into millions of dollars in earnings.
“If the guy gets back in the White House, they’ve got him over a barrel,” said Richard Painter, a former ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush who later ran for Senate in Minnesota as a Democrat.
Financial statements and court records detail how both Axos Bank and Hankey have faced heightened oversight under Democrats.
The Securities and Exchange Commission investigated Axos during Barack Obama’s presidency after a whistleblower filed a lawsuit accusing the bank of violating anti-money laundering rules, court records show. The investigation was closed in 2017 once Trump became president, while the whistleblower lawsuit was settled out of court.
Hankey, who made his fortune selling high-interest auto loans to those with bad credit histories, has faced similar scrutiny. In 2015, one of his companies, Westlake Services, was forced to pay $48 million in penalties and compensation after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — an agency created by Obama and often criticized by Trump administration officials — found that they used debt collection tactics that the bureau described as “illegal.”
Westlake also paid $700,000 to resolve a 2017 Justice Department lawsuit, which accused the company of illegally repossessing at least 70 vehicles owned by members of the military. While monitoring Westlake’s compliance with the settlement, the DOJ found the company had failed to grant service members an interest rate benefit required under law, leading to an additional $225,000 settlement in 2022, records show.
Hankey did not respond to requests for comment made directly to him, as well as to an attorney for his company. Trump’s campaign also did not respond to an inquiry. Officials for Axos, a midsized California-based bank that was formerly known as Bank of the Internet, did not address the SEC investigation in a brief statement.
In its statement, Axos Bank said it faced little risk from its lending to Trump, holding a “net principal balance exposure of less than $100 million.”
Axos CEO Gregory Garrabrants donated $4,800 to Trump’s campaign. But both the bank and Hankey have previously said that politics, or an affinity for Trump, had no bearing on their decision to lend him money.
Trump left the White House as a pariah in the business world following his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, which culminated in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. He also faced looming deadlines to pay off massive loans taken out on Trump Tower as well as his Doral golf course resort in Miami.
Axos stepped up. The bank extended $225 million in loans to Trump in 2022, enabling him to pay off those two outstanding debts just as they were about to come due, records show.
When Trump was looking to exit his hotel lease of Washington’s historic Old Post Office building, the company again came through, providing a $190 million loan that helped a Miami-based investor group complete the $375 million sale in 2022, according to property records.
Axos said it provided the financing to backstop the primary lender in the deal, MSD Partners.
Many hotel brokers, owners and consultants did not expect the 263-room hotel down the street from the White House to fetch such a high price. The hotel lost more than $70 million during the four years of Trump’s presidency, including in each year before pandemic shutdowns. But when the sale closed Trump’s companies made as much as $100 million, the Associated Press reported at the time.
This week, the latest tranche of Axos-connected financing came through when Hankey stepped forward through one of his companies, Knight Specialty Insurance, to post a $175 million bond that Trump was required to post as he appeals a $454 million judgment in his New York civil fraud trial.
Hankey owns a roughly 5% stake in Axos Bank, making him the bank’s largest individual shareholder, according to financial filings made with the SEC.
“This is what we do at Knight Insurance, and we’re happy to do this for anyone who needs a bond,” said Hankey earlier this week after Trump made the bond. He previously told the AP that he has never met or spoken with Trump.
On Thursday, New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office objected to the bond in a court filing, requesting that Knight Insurance file additional paperwork showing that the company was financially sound and had adequate collateral to cover the amount.
Hankey, who donated $80,000 to Trump and the Republican Party in 2016, maintains politics did not influence his decision to offer help. He previously said Trump offered up both cash and bonds as collateral.
“I’m chairman of the board of several companies, and we just carry on our business and we try to stay away from political issues or taking sides,” Hankey told The Washington Post.
That offers little assurance to Trump critics who closely tracked the transactional nature of his presidency.
“There are multiple layers of questions about what is Hankey’s relationship to Trump and to others in Trump’s orbit,” said Norman Eisen, a former Obama “ethics czar” who is now senior fellow at the liberal-leaning Brookings Institution. “What are his interests? How might Trump favor his interests? How might others?”

Taiwan was struck Wednesday by its most powerful earthquake in a quarter of a century. At least nine people were killed and hundreds injured, buildings and highways damaged and dozens of workers at quarries stranded.
Taiwan is no stranger to powerful earthquakes yet their toll on the high-tech island’s 23 million residents has been relatively contained thanks to its excellent earthquake preparedness, experts say.
Here is a closer look at Taiwan’s history of earthquakes:
WHY SO MANY TEMBLORS?
Taiwan lies along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” the line of seismic faults encircling the Pacific Ocean where most of the world’s earthquakes occur.
The area is particularly vulnerable to temblors due to the tension accumulated from the interactions of two tectonic plates, the Philippine Sea Plate and the Eurasian Plate, which may lead to sudden releases in the form of earthquakes.
The region’s mountainous landscape can magnify the ground shaking, leading to landslides. Several such landslides occurred on Taiwan’s eastern coast near the epicenter of Wednesday’s quake near eastern Hualien County, when falling debris hit tunnels and highways, crushing vehicles and causing several deaths.
HOW WELL-EQUIPPED IS TAIWAN TO HANDLE QUAKES?
Wednesday’s earthquake measured 7.2, according to Taiwan’s earthquake monitoring agency, while the U.S. Geological Survey put it at 7.4. It damaged several buildings in Hualien but caused only minor losses in the capital Taipei despite being strongly felt there.
The earthquake hit in the middle of the morning rush hour yet only slightly derailed the regular commute. Just minutes later, parents were again walking their children to school and workers driving to offices.
“Taiwan’s earthquake preparedness is among the most advanced in the world,” said Stephen Gao, a seismologist and professor at Missouri University of Science and Technology. “The island has implemented strict building codes, a world-class seismological network, and widespread public education campaigns on earthquake safety.”
The government continually revises the level of quake resistance required of new and existing buildings — which may increase construction costs — and offers subsidies to residents willing to check their buildings’ quake resistance.
Following a 2016 quake in Tainan, on the island’s southwestern coast, five people involved in the construction of a 17-story high-rise apartment building that was the only major structure to have collapsed, killing dozens, were found guilty of negligence and given prison sentences.
Taiwan also is pushing quake drills at schools and workplaces while public media and cellphones regularly carry notices about earthquakes and safety.
“These measures have significantly enhanced Taiwan’s resilience to earthquakes, helping to mitigate the potential for catastrophic damage and loss of life,” Gao said.
THE 1999 QUAKE WAS A WAKE-UP CALL
Taiwan and its surrounding waters have registered about 2,000 earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.0 or greater since 1980, and more than 100 earthquakes with a magnitude above 5.5, according to the USGS.
The island’s worst quake in recent years struck on Sept. 21, 1999, with a magnitude of 7.7. It caused 2,400 deaths, injured around 100,000 and destroyed thousands of buildings.
It was also a major wake-up call that led to key administrative reforms to improve emergency response and disaster reduction, according to Daniel Aldrich, professor of political science and public policy at Northeastern University.
“Observers strongly criticized Taiwan’s response to the 21 September 1999 earthquake, arguing that it took hours for emergency medical response teams to arrive, that rescuers lacked training, and that the operations between government agencies were not well coordinated,” he wrote in an email. As a result, the government passed the Disaster Prevention and Protection Act and set up two national centers to handle coordination and training for earthquakes.
“I think we’re seeing the results in this most recent shock,” he said.

War, famine, and poverty are on the rise. Hearing about it every single day at home, online and on your phone is enough to make you want to hide.
And many have.
The rate of people actively avoiding the news at least part of the time is skyrocketing. A report by the Reuters institute found around 36 percent of people believed that interacting with the news lowered their mood.
Cost of living, dangerous diets, a climate crisis, generational divides — all day, all night, all forced into your brain. The sheer scale of media present in our pockets is causing an overload of information, intended to evoke an emotional response.
It is having a numbing effect on the way we see the world and what issues we care about.
Brain imaging research tells us there is a limit to the amount of empathy humans can deal with.
Empathy allows us to ""feel"" other people's emotions and is an important social skill, but it has a downside.
In many cases, feeling others' pain so acutely, so often can lead to ""empathic distress"".
Empathic distress is when a person who witnesses other people's suffering wants to avoid or withdraw from the situation.
A key brain imaging study showed that when people were shown footage from news or documentaries of people suffering, it triggered pain networks in their brain.
It is a very human response, performed by your empathy for pain network. The empathy for pain network appears to be a basic inbuilt mechanism. Caregivers have to recognize when their offspring are in pain and attempt to help, otherwise the species would not survive.
A range of studies have indicated that empathy for another's pain can trigger the same networks involved in experiencing pain yourself.
Interestingly, one avenue for protecting against empathic distress is compassion. Compassion is a concerned response to another's suffering combined with a desire to alleviate the other's suffering.
Compassion moves beyond empathy's feeling focus and is more action oriented, focusing on what can be done to alleviate the other's suffering. Compassion is asking oneself ""What is the most constructive thing I can do for the other?"".
A growing body of researchers are suggesting the widely used term ‘compassion fatigue' should actually be called ‘empathic distress fatigue'.
Brain imaging research shows compassion and empathy have different neural networks. Compassion involves feelings of warmth, concern, caring and motivates prosocial actions and behavior.
A landmark 2014 study showed that compassion reversed the negative effects of empathic distress and strengthened positive affect and brain networks linked to affiliation and reward. Compassion training may be an important technique to overcome empathic distress and reduce burnout.
Around the world, there is growing interest in compassion training for professions that are regularly exposed to the suffering of others, for example journalists, healthcare workers, teachers and law enforcement.
A shift from empathy to compassion may be useful for anyone to manage exposure to news stories where others are suffering. At the very least, compassion is a positive mind state that potentially motivates prosocial action.
Wishing to avoid exposure to the suffering of others is understandable. But in practice it is difficult to achieve.
Humans are vulnerable to sickness, injury, accidents and other forms of suffering. Avoiding thinking about the suffering of others means one may be ill equipped if presented with a real crisis requiring action.
Some people have stopped reading the news altogether as they find it leads to feelings of hopelessness, helplessness and a general negative feeling of human nature.
It is important to remember that news headlines present a restricted range of human behavior. The negativity bias means we pay more attention to negative news than positive news.
It is easy to forget that all over the world healthcare workers are caring for the sick, teachers are educating the young and parents are looking after their children. There are positive stories that show humans' deep evolutionary capacity for care, cooperation and compassion.
There are instances when there is nothing we can do to help the other person. Staying with empathy in this situation puts us at risk of empathy overload and getting overwhelmed by empathic distress.
Our personal distress is no help to the other person who is already suffering. It is better for our own wellbeing to accept that some of the suffering in the world is the result of complex issues which are not in our direct control. No single individual is able to fix all of the world's problems.
Consciously seeking exposure to good news stories and reflecting on the uplifting aspects of human nature can help build a balanced perspective. We can reflect on our own experiences of compassion.
There are often myriad of small acts by others that have had a positive influence on us. Reflecting on this heightens our sense of connectedness to others. We realize that acts of kindness, no matter how small, can be significant, even if it doesn't seem so at the time. Cooperative helping behavior is also observed in a wide range of species including ants, bees, dolphins, elephants and monkeys.
If we find ourselves falling into empathy overload, shift to compassion which can protect us from empathic distress.
Take stock of your position and remember that the complex world we live in also contains many positive and inspiring aspects. Remember that although we don't have control over most external events, we do have control over how we respond to them.

Taiwan’s strongest earthquake in a quarter century rocked the island during the morning rush hour Wednesday, damaging buildings and highways and leaving seven people dead.
In the capital, Taipei, tiles fell from older buildings as the earthquake shook the city, and schools evacuated their students to sports fields, equipping them with yellow safety helmets. Some children covered themselves with textbooks to guard against falling objects as aftershocks continued. Afterward, a five-story building in Hualien County, near the offshore epicenter, was left leaning at a 45-degree angle, with its first floor collapsed.
Taiwan’s national fire agency said seven people died in the quake, which struck just before 8 a.m. The local United Daily News reported three hikers died in rockslides in Taroko National Park and a van driver died in the same area after boulders hit the vehicle.
Government statistics showed 736 people were injured and 77 stranded. The quake and aftershocks also caused 24 landslides and damage to 35 roads, bridges and tunnels.
Taiwan’s earthquake monitoring agency said the quake was 7.2 magnitude while the U.S. Geological Survey put it at 7.4. It struck about 18 kilometers (11.1 miles) south-southwest of Hualien and was about 35 kilometers (21 miles) deep. Multiple aftershocks followed, and the USGS said one of the subsequent quakes was 6.5 magnitude and 11.8 kilometers (7 miles) deep. Shallower quakes tend to cause more surface damage. The earthquake triggered a tsunami warning that was later lifted.
Authorities said they had expected a relatively mild quake of magnitude 4 and accordingly did not send out alerts. Still, the earthquake was strong enough to scare people who are used to such shaking.
“Earthquakes are a common occurrence, and I’ve grown accustomed to them. But today was the first time I was scared to tears by an earthquake,” said Hsien-hsuen Keng, a resident who lives in a fifth-floor apartment in Taipei. ”I was awakened by the earthquake. I had never felt such intense shaking before.”
Television images showed neighbors and rescue workers lifting residents, including a toddler, through windows and onto the street. All appeared mobile, in shock but without serious injuries. Doors had been fused shut by the pressure of the tilt.
The national legislature, a converted school built before World War II, and sections of the main airport in Taoyuan, just south of Taipei, also saw minor damage.
Traffic along the east coast was at a virtual standstill after the earthquake, with landslides and falling debris hitting tunnels and highways in the mountainous region. Train service was suspended across the island of 23 million people, as was subway service in the capital, Taipei, where a newly constructed above-ground line partially separated.
The Japan Meteorological Agency said a tsunami wave of 30 centimeters (about 1 foot) was detected on the coast of Yonaguni island about 15 minutes after the quake struck. Smaller waves were measured in Ishigaki and Miyako islands.
The earthquake was felt in Shanghai and several provinces along China’s southeastern coast, according to Chinese media. China and Taiwan are about 160 kilometers (100 miles) apart. China issued no tsunami warnings for the Chinese mainland and all such alerts in the region had been lifted by Wednesday afternoon.
The initial panic after the earthquake quickly faded on the island, which is regularly rocked by temblors and prepares for them with drills at schools and notices issued via public media and mobile phone.
By noon, the metro station in the busy northern Taipei suburb of Beitou was again buzzing with people commuting to jobs and seniors arriving to visit the hot springs or travel the mountain paths at the base of an extinct volcano.
Stephen Gao, a seismologist and professor at Missouri University of Science and Technology, said Taiwan’s earthquake preparedness is among the most advanced in the world, featuring strict building codes, a world-class seismological network, and widespread public education campaigns on earthquake safety.
Hualien was last struck by a deadly quake in 2018 that collapsed a historic hotel and other buildings. Taiwan’s worst quake in recent years struck on Sept. 21, 1999, with a magnitude of 7.7, causing 2,400 deaths, injuring around 100,000 and destroying thousands of buildings.
Taiwan lies along the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” the line of seismic faults encircling the Pacific Ocean where most of the world’s earthquakes occur.
The economic fallout from the quake has yet to be calculated, but Taiwan is the leading manufacturer of the world’s most sophisticated computer chips and other high-technology items that are highly sensitive to seismic events. Parts of the electricity grid were also shut down, possibly leading to disruptions in the supply chain and financial losses.
Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC, which supplies semiconductors to companies such as Apple, said it evacuated employees from some of its factories in Hsinchu, southwest of Taipei. Hsinchu authorities said water and electricity supplies for all the factories in the city’s science park were functioning as normal.
The Taiwan stock exchange opened as usual on Wednesday, with the index wavering between losses and gains.

US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed Taiwan, artificial intelligence and security issues Tuesday in a call meant to demonstrate a return to regular leader-to-leader dialogue between the two powers.
The call, described by the White House as “candid and constructive,” was the leaders’ first conversation since their November summit in California produced renewed ties between the two nations’ militaries and a promise of enhanced cooperation on stemming the flow of deadly fentanyl and its precursors from China.
Xi told Biden that the two countries should adhere to the bottom line of “no clash, no confrontation” as one of the principles for this year.
“We should prioritize stability, not provoke troubles, not cross lines but maintain the overall stability of China-U.S. relations,” Xi said, according to China Central Television, the state broadcaster.
The roughly 105 minute call kicks off several weeks of high-level engagements between the two countries, with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen set to travel to China on Thursday and Secretary of State Antony Blinken to follow in the weeks ahead.
Biden has pressed for sustained interactions at all levels of government, believing it is key to keeping competition between the two massive economies and nuclear-armed powers from escalating to direct conflict. While in-person summits take place perhaps once a year, officials said, both Washington and Beijing recognize the value of more frequent engagements between the leaders.
The two leaders discussed Taiwan ahead of next month’s inauguration of Lai Ching-te, the island’s president-elect, who has vowed to safeguard its de-facto independence from China and further align it with other democracies. Biden reaffirmed the United States’ longstanding “One China” policy and reiterated that the U.S. opposes any coercive means to bring Taiwan under Beijing’s control. China considers Taiwan a domestic matter and has vigorously protested U.S. support for the island.
Taiwan remains the “first red line not to be crossed,” Xi told Biden, and emphasized that Beijing will not tolerate separatist activities by Taiwan’s independence forces as well as “exterior indulgence and support,” which alluded to Washington’s support for the island.
Biden also raised concerns about China’s operations in the South China Sea, including efforts last month to impede the Philippines, which the U.S. is treaty-obligated to defend, from resupplying its forces on the disputed Second Thomas Shoal.
Next week, Biden will host Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the White House for a joint summit where China’s influence in the region was set to be top of the agenda.
Biden, in the call with Xi, pressed China to do more to meet its commitments to halt the flow of illegal narcotics and to schedule additional precursor chemicals to prevent their export. The pledge was made at the leaders’ summit held in Woodside, California, last year on the margins of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting.
At the November summit, Biden and Xi also agreed that their governments would hold formal talks on the promises and risks of advanced artificial intelligence, which are set to take place in the coming weeks. The pair touched on the issue on Tuesday just two weeks after China and the U.S. joined more than 120 other nations in backing a resolution at the United Nations calling for global safeguards around the emerging technology.
Biden, in the call, reinforced warnings to Xi against interfering in the 2024 elections in the U.S. as well as against continued malicious cyberattacks against critical American infrastructure.
He also raised concerns about human rights in China, including Hong Kong’s new restrictive national security law and its treatment of minority groups, and he raised the plight of Americans detained in or barred from leaving China.
The Democratic president also pressed China over its defense relationship with Russia, which is seeking to rebuild its industrial base as it presses forward with its invasion of Ukraine. And he called on Beijing to wield its influence over North Korea to rein in the isolated and erratic nuclear power.
As the leaders of the world’s two largest economies, Biden also raised concerns with Xi over China’s “unfair economic practices,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, and reasserted that the U.S. would take steps to preserve its security and economic interests, including by continuing to limit the transfer of some advanced technology to China.
Xi complained that the U.S. has taken more measures to suppress China’s economy, trade and technology in the past several months and that the list of sanctioned Chinese companies has become ever longer, which is “not de-risking but creating risks,” according to the broadcaster.
Yun Sun, director of the China program at Stimson Center, said the call “does reflect the mutual desire to keep the relationship stable” while the men reiterated their longstanding positions on issues of concern.
The call came ahead of Yellen’s visit to Guangzhou and Beijing for a week of bilateral meetings on the subject with finance leaders from the world’s second largest economy — including Vice Premier He Lifeng, Chinese Central Bank Gov. Pan Gongsheng, former Vice Premier Liu He, American businesses and local leaders.
An advisory for the upcoming trip states that Yellen “will advocate for American workers and businesses to ensure they are treated fairly, including by pressing Chinese counterparts on unfair trade practices.”
It follows Xi’s meeting in Beijing with U.S. business leaders last week, when he emphasized the mutually beneficial economic ties between the two countries and urged people-to-people exchange to maintain the relationship.
Xi told the Americans that the two countries have stayed communicative and “made progress” on issues such as trade, anti-narcotics and climate change since he met with Biden in November. Last week’s high-profile meeting was seen as Beijing’s effort to stabilize bilateral relations.
Ahead of her trip to China, Yellen last week said that Beijing is flooding the market with green energy that “distorts global prices.” She said she intends to share her beliefs with her counterparts that Beijing’s increased production of solar energy, electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries poses risks to productivity and growth to the global economy.
U.S. lawmakers’ renewed angst over Chinese ownership of the popular social media app TikTok has generated new legislation that would ban TikTok if its China-based owner ByteDance doesn’t sell its stakes in the platform within six months of the bill’s enactment. Kirby said Biden “reiterated our concerns about the ownership of TikTok” to Xi during their call.
As chair of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which reviews foreign ownership of firms in the U.S., Yellen has ample leeway to determine how the company could remain operating in the U.S.
Meanwhile, China’s leaders have set a goal of 5% economic growth this year despite a slowdown exacerbated by troubles in the property sector and the lingering effects of strict anti-virus measures during the COVID-19 pandemic that disrupted travel, logistics, manufacturing and other industries.
China is the dominant player in batteries for electric vehicles and has a rapidly expanding auto industry that could challenge the world’s established carmakers as it goes global.
The U.S. last year outlined plans to limit EV buyers from claiming tax credits if they purchase cars containing battery materials from China and other countries that are considered hostile to the United States. Separately, the Department of Commerce launched an investigation into the potential national security risks posed by Chinese car exports to the U.S.

NASA wants to come up with an out-of-this-world way to keep track of time, putting the moon on its own souped-up clock.
It’s not quite a time zone like those on Earth, but an entire frame of time reference for the moon. Because there’s less gravity on the moon, time there moves a tad quicker — 58.7 microseconds every day — compared to Earth. So the White House Tuesday instructed NASA and other U.S agencies to work with international agencies to come up with a new moon-centric time reference system.
“An atomic clock on the moon will tick at a different rate than a clock on Earth,” said Kevin Coggins, NASA’s top communications and navigation official. “It makes sense that when you go to another body, like the moon or Mars that each one gets its own heartbeat.”
So everything on the moon will operate on the speeded-up moon time, Coggins said.
The last time NASA sent astronauts to the moon they wore watches, but timing wasn’t as precise and critical as it now with GPS, satellites and intricate computer and communications systems, he said. Those microseconds matter when high tech systems interact, he said.
Last year, the European Space Agency said Earth needs to come up with a unified time for the moon, where a day lasts 29.5 Earth days.
The International Space Station, being in low Earth orbit, will continue to use coordinated universal time or UTC. But just where the new space time kicks in is something that NASA has to figure out. Even Earth’s time speeds up and slows down, requiring leap seconds.
Unlike on Earth, the moon will not have daylight saving time, Coggins said.
The White House wants NASA to come up with a preliminary idea by the end of the year and have a final plan by the end of 2026.
NASA is aiming to send astronauts around the moon in September 2025 and land people there a year later.

Some of Israel’s closest allies, including the United States, on Tuesday condemned the deaths of seven aid workers who were killed by airstrikes in Gaza — a loss that prompted multiple charities to suspend food deliveries to Palestinians on the brink of starvation.
The deaths of the World Central Kitchen workers threatened to set back efforts by the U.S. and other countries to open a maritime corridor for aid from Cyprus to help ease the desperate conditions in northern Gaza.
President Joe Biden issued an unusually blunt criticism of Israel by its closest ally, suggesting that the incident demonstrated that Israel was not doing enough to protect civilians.
“Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately needed help to civilians,” he said, adding he was “outraged and heartbroken” by their killings.
“Incidents like yesterday’s simply should not happen,” he added. “The United States has repeatedly urged Israel to deconflict their military operations against Hamas with humanitarian operations, in order to avoid civilian casualties.”
Ships still laden with some 240 tons of aid from the charitable group turned back from Gaza just a day after arriving, according to Cyprus. Other humanitarian aid organizations also suspended operations in Gaza, saying it was too dangerous to offer help. Israel has allowed only a trickle of food and supplies into Gaza’s devastated north, where experts say famine is imminent.
The dead from Monday night’s strikes included three British citizens, Polish and Australia nationals, a Canadian-American dual national and a Palestinian. Those countries have been key backers of Israel’s nearly 6-month-old offensive in Gaza, and several of them denounced the killings.
Israel already faces growing isolation as international criticism of the Gaza assault has mounted. On the same day as the deadly airstrikes, Israel stirred more fears by apparently striking Iran’s consulate in Damascus and killing two Iranian generals. The government also moved to shut down a foreign media outlet — Qatari-owned Al Jazeera television.
The hit on the charity’s convoy also highlighted what critics have called Israel’s indiscriminate bombing and lack of regard for civilian casualties in Gaza.
Israel’s military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, announced the results of a preliminary investigation early Wednesday.
“It was a mistake that followed a misidentification – at night during a war in very complex conditions. It shouldn’t have happened,” he said. He gave no further details. He said an independent body would conduct a “thorough investigation” that would be completed in the coming days.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had earlier acknowledged the “unintended strike ... on innocent people” and said officials would work to ensure it does not happen again.
World Central Kitchen said it had coordinated with the Israeli military over the movement of its cars. Three vehicles moving at large distances apart were hit in succession. They were left incinerated and mangled, indicating multiple targeted strikes.
At least one of the vehicles had the charity’s logo printed across its roof to make it identifiable from the air, and the ordnance punched a large hole through the roof. Footage showed the bodies at a hospital in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah, several of them wearing protective gear with the charity’s logo.
Israeli TV said the initial military investigation found that the army identified the cars carrying World Central Kitchen’s workers arriving at its warehouse in Deir al-Balah and observed suspected militants nearby. Half an hour later, the vehicles were struck by the air force as they headed south. The reports said it was not clear who ordered the strikes or why.
Throughout the war, Israel has said it seeks to avoid civilian casualties and uses sophisticated intelligence to target Hamas and other militants. Israeli authorities blame them for civilian deaths because they operate in populated areas.
At the same time, Israel has also insisted that no target is off-limits. Israeli forces have repeatedly struck ambulances and vehicles carrying aid, as well as relief organization offices and U.N. shelters, claiming that armed fighters were in them.
Israeli forces have also shown a readiness to inflict widespread destruction on suspicion of a militant presence or out of tactical need. Homes with Palestinian families sheltering inside are leveled by strikes almost daily with no explanation of the intended target. Videos of strikes released by the military often show them hitting individuals without visible weapons, while identifying them as militants.
More than 32,900 Palestinians have been killed in the war, around two-thirds of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count.
Celebrity chef José Andrés, who founded the World Central Kitchen charity, said he was “heartbroken” by the deaths of the staffers.
“The Israeli government needs to stop this indiscriminate killing. It needs to stop restricting humanitarian aid, stop killing civilians and aid workers, and stop using food as a weapon,” he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.
The U.S., Britain, Poland, Australia and Canada all called on Israel to give answers on the deaths. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant launched an investigation and ordered the opening of a joint situation room enabling coordination between the military and aid groups.
But anger among its allies could put new pressure on Israel.
The British government summoned Israel’s ambassador for a rebuke and called for an immediate humanitarian pause to allow more aid in and the release of hostages.
British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak told Netanyahu that he was “appalled” by the workers’ deaths and described the situation in Gaza as “increasingly intolerable.”
A senior Canadian government official said there will be a joint formal diplomatic rebuke at the foreign ministry in Israel on Wednesday. The official also said a top official with Canada’s Global Affairs department made a formal representation to Israel ambassador’s to Canada on Tuesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
The deaths sent a further chill through U.N. agencies and other aid groups that have said for months that sending truck convoys around Gaza — particularly in the north — has been extremely difficult because of the military’s failure to either grant permission or ensure safe passage. Israel has barred UNRWA, the main U.N. agency in Gaza, from making deliveries to the north.
The U.S. and other countries have been working to set up the sea passage from Cyprus to get around the difficulties.
World Central Kitchen was key to the new route. It and the United Arab Emirates sent a pilot shipment last month. Their second delivery of around 400 tons of food and supplies arrived in three ships to Gaza hours before the strikes on the convoy.
Around 100 tons were unloaded before the charity suspended operations, and the rest was being taken back to Cyprus, Cypriot Foreign Ministry spokesman Theodoros Gotsis said.
Still, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides said Tuesday that ship deliveries would continue.
Anera, a Washington-based aid group that has been operating in the Palestinian territories for decades, said that in the wake of the strikes it was taking the “unprecedented” step of pausing its own operations in Gaza, where it had been helping to provide around 150,000 meals daily.
“The escalating risks associated with aid delivery leave us with no choice,” it said in a statement.
Jamie McGoldrick, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, said the strikes were “not an isolated incident.” The U.N. says more than 180 humanitarian workers have been killed in the war.
“This is nearly three times the death toll recorded in any single conflict in a year,” he said.
The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel in a surprise attack on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage. Israel responded with one of the deadliest and most destructive offensives in recent history.
Two other Israeli strikes late Monday killed at least 16 Palestinians, including eight children, in Rafah, where Israel has vowed to expand its ground operation. The city on the Egyptian border is now home to some 1.4 million Palestinians, most of whom have sought refuge from fighting elsewhere.
One strike hit a family home, killing 10 people, including five children, according to hospital records. Another hit a gathering near a mosque, killing at least six people, including three children.

An Israeli airstrike that demolished Iran’s consulate in Syria on Monday killed two Iranian generals and five officers, according to Iranian officials. The strike appeared to signify an escalation of Israel’s targeting of military officials from Iran, which supports militant groups fighting Israel in Gaza, and along its border with Lebanon.
Since the war in Gaza began nearly six months ago, clashes have increased between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah militants based in Lebanon. Hamas, which rules Gaza and attacked Israel on Oct. 7, is also backed by Iran.
Israel, which rarely acknowledges strikes against Iranian targets, said it had no comment on the latest attack in Syria, although a military spokesman blamed Iran for a drone attack early Monday against a naval base in southern Israel.
Israel has grown increasingly impatient with the daily exchanges of fire with Hezbollah, which have escalated in recent days, and warned of the possibility of a full-fledged war. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have also been launching long-range missiles toward Israel, including on Monday.
The airstrike in Syria killed Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who led the elite Quds Force in Lebanon and Syria until 2016, according to Iran’s Revolutionary Guard. It also killed Zahedi’s deputy, Gen Mohammad Hadi Hajriahimi, and five other officers.
A member of Hezbollah, Hussein Youssef, also was killed in the attack, an official with the militant group told The Associated Press. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with group’s rules. Hezbollah has not publicly announced the death.
Hezbollah offered condolences to Iran for Zahedi’s death and called Israel “foolish when it believes that liquidating the leaders can stop the roaring tide of the people’s resistance.” It added in its statement that the killing “will not pass without the enemy receiving punishment and revenge.”
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which is based in Britain, said two Syrians also were killed.
Two police officers who guarded the consulate were among those wounded, and first responders were still searching for bodies under the rubble.
While Iran’s consular building was leveled in the attack, according to Syria’s state news agency, its main embassy building remained intact. Still, the Iranian ambassador’s residence was inside the consular building.
Iran’s ambassador, Hossein Akbari, vowed revenge for the strike “at the same magnitude and harshness.”
Hamas and Islamic Jihad — another Palestinian militant group backed by Iran — accused Israel of seeking to widen the conflict in Gaza.
Experts said there was no doubt that Iran would retaliate. The strike in Syria was a “major escalation,” Charles Lister, a Syria expert at the Middle East Institute in Washington, said on the social media platform X.
A spokesman for Iran’s foreign ministry, Nasser Kanaani, called on other countries to condemn the strike.
Israel has attacked scores of Iranian-linked targets in Syria over the years with the apparent intent of disrupting arms transfers and other cooperation with Hezbollah. which has sent thousands of fighters to support Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces.
An Israeli airstrike in a Damascus neighborhood in December killed a longtime Iranian Revolutionary Guard adviser to Syria, Seyed Razi Mousavi.
A similar strike on a building in Damascus in January killed at least five Iranian advisers. Last week, an Iranian adviser was killed in airstrikes over the eastern Syrian province of Deir el-Zour, near the Iraqi border.
The chief spokesman for Israel’s army, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, said a Monday drone attack on a naval base in southern Israel was “directed by Iran” and caused no injuries.
Early on Tuesday, the Israeli military said some kind of weapon fired from Syria toward Israel crashed before reaching its intended target.

Donald Trump posted a $175 million bond on Monday in his New York civil fraud case, halting collection of the more than $454 million he owes and preventing the state from seizing his assets to satisfy the debt while he appeals, according to a court filing.
A New York appellate court had given the former president 10 days to put up the money after a panel of judges agreed last month to slash the amount needed to stop the clock on enforcement.
The bond Trump is posting with the court now is essentially a placeholder, meant to guarantee payment if the judgment is upheld. If that happens, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee will have to pay the state the whole sum, which grows with daily interest.
If Trump wins, he won’t have to pay the state anything and will get back the money he has put up now.
“As promised, President Trump has posted bond. He looks forward to vindicating his rights on appeal and overturning this unjust verdict,” said one of Trump’s lawyers, Alina Habba.
Until the appeals court intervened to lower the required bond, New York Attorney General Letitia James had been poised to initiate efforts to collect the judgment, possibly by seizing some of Trump’s marquee properties. James, a Democrat, brought the lawsuit on the state’s behalf. Her office declined to comment Monday.
The court ruled after Trump’s lawyers complained it was “a practical impossibility” to get an underwriter to sign off on a bond for the $454 million, plus interest, that he owes.
The company that underwrote the bond is Knight Specialty Insurance, which is part of the Knight Insurance Group. The chairman of that company, billionaire Don Hankey, told The Associated Press that both cash and bond were used as collateral for Trump’s appellate bond.
“This is what we do at Knight Insurance, and we’re happy to do this for anyone who needs a bond,” said Hankey, who is best known in the business world for making high-risk, high-interest loans to car buyers with flawed credit histories. Hankey told the AP he has never met or spoken with Trump.
Trump is fighting to overturn a judge’s Feb. 16 finding that he lied about his wealth as he fostered the real estate empire that launched him to stardom and the presidency. The trial focused on how Trump’s assets were valued on financial statements that went to bankers and insurers to get loans and deals.
Trump denies any wrongdoing, saying the statements actually lowballed his fortune, came with disclaimers and weren’t taken at face value by the institutions that lent to or insured him.
The state courts’ Appellate Division has said it would hear arguments in September. A specific date has not been set. If the schedule holds, it will fall in the final weeks of the presidential race.
Under New York law, filing an appeal generally doesn’t hold off enforcement of a judgment. But there’s an automatic pause — in legalese, a stay — if the person or entity obtains a bond guaranteeing payment of what’s owed.
Courts sometimes grant exceptions and lower the amount required for a stay, as in Trump’s case.
Trump’s lawyers had told the appeals court more than 30 bonding companies were unwilling to take a mix of cash and real estate as collateral for a $454 million-plus bond. Underwriters insisted on only cash, stocks or other liquid assets, the attorneys said.
They said most bonding companies require collateral covering 120% of the amount owed.
Trump recently claimed to have almost a half-billion dollars in cash — along with billions of dollars worth of real estate and other assets — but said he wanted to have some cash available for his presidential run.
Recent legal debts have taken a sizable chunk out of Trump’s cash reserves.
In addition to the $175 million he had to put up in the New York case, Trump has posted a bond and cash worth more than $97 million to cover money he owes to writer E. Jean Carroll while he appeals verdicts in a pair of federal civil trials. Juries found that he sexually assaulted her in the 1990s and defamed her when she went public with the allegation in 2019. He denies all the allegations.
In February, Trump paid the $392,638 in legal fees a judge ordered him to cover for The New York Times and three reporters after he unsuccessfully sued them over a Pulitzer Prize-winning 2018 story about his family’s wealth and tax practices.
In March, a British court ordered Trump to pay to pay legal fees of 300,000 pounds ($382,000) to a company he unsuccessfully sued over the so-called Steele dossier that contained salacious allegations about him. Trump said those claims were false.
Trump could eventually generate cash by selling some of the nearly 60% of stock he owns in his newly public social media company, Trump Media & Technology Group — but that would be a longer-term play. Trump’s stake could be worth billions of dollars, but a “lock-up” provision prevents insiders like him from selling their shares for six months.

A court in India on Monday placed a top opposition leader in two weeks of judicial detention after his 10 days in the custody of a federal agency expired, in a case that opposition parties say is part of a crackdown by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government on rivals ahead of a national election later this month.
Arvind Kejriwal, the leader of the Aam Aadmi Party, or Common Man’s Party, is the top elected official in the city of New Delhi and one of the country’s most consequential politicians of the past decade.
He was arrested by the federal Enforcement Directorate on March 21. The agency, controlled by Modi’s government, accused Kejriwal’s party and ministers of accepting 1 billion rupees ($12 million) in bribes from liquor contractors nearly two years ago. The arrest triggered days of protests by hundreds of party activists supported by other opposition parties.
The Aam Aadmi Party denied the accusations and said Kejriwal will remain as New Delhi’s chief minister as it fights the case in court. The party is part of a broad alliance of opposition parties called INDIA, which is the main challenger to Modi’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party in the coming elections.
A day after Kejriwal’s arrest, the court remanded him to six days of custody by the Enforcement Directorate that was extended by another four days on Thursday. With the expiration of his detention by the directorate on Monday, the New Delhi court ordered him held in judicial custody until April 15.
Kejriwal’s case has dominated the news in India ahead of the general election, which starts April 19. Opposition parties say the government is misusing federal investigation agencies to harass and weaken its political opponents. They point to a series of raids, arrests and corruption investigations of key opposition figures. Recently, the opposition Congress party accused the government of crippling the party by freezing its bank accounts in a tax dispute.
Modi’s party denies using law enforcement agencies to target the opposition and says the agencies act independently.
Kejriwal’s arrest is seen as another setback for the opposition bloc. On Sunday, the bloc launched its election campaign with a massive rally in New Delhi at which opposition leaders criticized the arrest of Kejriwal and other colleagues.

An alliance of India’s opposition parties launched its election campaign with a massive rally Sunday that criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government of stifling opponents and undermining democracy ahead of a national election next month.
The “Save Democracy” rally in New Delhi was the first major show of strength by the opposition bloc INDIA. Modi on Sunday also launched a formal campaign for the election to be held over six weeks starting April 19.
Opposition leaders spoke to the flag-waving crowd and criticized Modi’s government for arresting several of their colleagues, including New Delhi’s top elected official Arvind Kejriwal on March 21. The leaders called the arrests undemocratic and accused Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, of using federal agencies to undermine the opposition.
Kejriwal was arrested by the federal Enforcement Directorate on charges that his party and state ministers had accepted 1 billion rupees ($12 million) in bribes from liquor contractors nearly two years ago. The Aam Aadmi Party, or Common Man’s Party, denied the accusations and said that Kejriwal would remain as New Delhi’s chief minister while the court decides on the next step.
In January, the agency arrested Hemant Soren — until then the chief minister of eastern Jharkhand state — for allegedly facilitating an illegal land sale. Soren’s party denies the charges.
“This battle is to safeguard the nation, democracy, constitution, future of the nation, youth, farmers and women. This battle is for justice and truth,” Deepender Singh Hooda, a lawmaker of the opposition Congress party, told reporters at the rally.
Kejriwal’s arrest is seen as a setback for the opposition bloc that is the main challenger of the BJP in the elections.
The BJP denies targeting the opposition and says law enforcement agencies act independently.
“Narendra Modi wants to strangle democracy and take away the option from the people to choose the government of their choice,” opposition leader Rahul Gandhi from the Congress party, who took part in Sunday’s rally, wrote on X.
Modi kicked off his campaign for a third term from the city of Meerut, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of New Delhi.
Modi said the opposition was uneasy because of the administration’s crackdown on corruption. “While Modi’s mantra is to eradicate corruption, their (opposition parties) credo is protect the corrupt,” he said.

Tens of thousands of Israelis thronged central Jerusalem on Sunday in the largest anti-government protest since the country went to war in October. Protesters urged the government to reach a cease-fire deal to free dozens of hostages held in Gaza by Hamas militants and to hold early elections.
Israeli society was broadly united immediately after Oct. 7, when Hamas killed some 1,200 people during a cross-border attack and took 250 others hostage. Nearly six months of conflict have renewed divisions over the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, though the country remains largely in favor of the war.
Netanyahu has vowed to destroy Hamas and bring all the hostages home, yet those goals have been elusive. While Hamas has suffered heavy losses, it remains intact.
Roughly half the hostages in Gaza were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November. But attempts by international mediators to bring home the remaining hostages have failed. Talks resumed on Sunday with no signs that a breakthrough was imminent.
Hostages’ families believe time is running out, and they are getting more vocal about their displeasure with Netanyahu.
“We believe that no hostages will come back with this government because they’re busy putting sticks in the wheels of negotiations for the hostages,” said Boaz Atzili, whose cousin, Aviv Atzili and his wife, Liat, were kidnapped on Oct. 7. Liat was released but Aviv was killed, and his body is in Gaza. “Netanyahu is only working in his private interests.”
PROTESTERS HAVE MANY GRIEVANCES
Protesters blame Netanyahu for the failures of Oct. 7 and say the deep political divisions over his attempted judicial overhaul last year weakened Israel ahead of the attack. Some accuse him of damaging relations with the United States, Israel’s most important ally.
Netanyahu is also facing a litany of corruption charges which are slowly making their way through the courts, and critics say his decisions appear to be focused on political survival over the national interest. Opinion polls show Netanyahu and his coalition trailing far behind their rivals if elections were held today.
Unless his governing coalition falls apart sooner, Netanyahu won’t face elections until spring of 2026.
Many families of hostages had refrained from publicly denouncing Netanyahu to avoid antagonizing the leadership and making the hostages’ plight a political issue. But as their anger grows, some now want to change course — and they played a major role in Sunday’s anti-government protest.
The crowd on Sunday stretched for blocks around the Knesset, or parliament building, and organizers vowed to continue the demonstration for several days. They urged the government to hold new elections nearly two years ahead of schedule. Thousands also demonstrated Sunday in Tel Aviv, where there was a large protest the night before.
Netanyahu, in a nationally televised speech before undergoing hernia surgery later Sunday, said he understood families’ pain. But he said calling new elections — in what he described as a moment before victory — would paralyze Israel for six to eight months and stall the hostage talks. For now, Netanyahu’s governing coalition appears to remain firmly intact.
Some hostage families agree that now is not the time for elections.
“I don’t think that changing the prime minister now is what will advance and help my son to come home,” Sheli Shem Tov, whose son Omer was kidnapped from a music festival, told Israel’s Channel 12. “To go to elections now will just push to the side the most burning issue, which is to return the hostages home.”
In his Sunday address, Netanyahu also repeated his vow for a military ground offensive in Rafah, the southern Gaza city where more than half of territory’s population of 2.3 million now shelters after fleeing fighting elsewhere. “There is no victory without going into Rafah,” he said, adding that U.S. pressure would not deter him. Israel’s military says Hamas battalions remain there.
In another reminder of Israel’s divisions, a group of reservists and retired officers demonstrated in an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood.
Ultra-Orthodox men for generations have received exemptions from military service, which is compulsory for most Jewish men and women. Resentment over that has deepened during the war. Netanyahu’s government has been ordered to present a new plan for a more equitable draft law by Monday.
Netanyahu, who relies heavily on the support of ultra-Orthodox parties, last week asked for an extension.
The Bank of Israel said in its annual report on Sunday that there could be economic damage if large numbers of ultra-Orthodox men continue not to serve in Israel’s military.
ISRAELI AIRSTRIKE HITS TENT CAMP AT HOSPITAL
Also Sunday, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent camp in the courtyard of a crowded hospital in central Gaza, killing two Palestinians and wounding another 15, including journalists working nearby.
An Associated Press reporter filmed the strike and aftermath at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah, where thousands of people have sheltered. The Israeli military said it struck a command center of the Islamic Jihad militant group.
Tens of thousands of people have sought shelter in Gaza’s hospitals, viewing them as relatively safe from airstrikes. Israel accuses Hamas and other militants of operating in and around medical facilities, which Gaza’s health officials deny.
Israeli troops have been raiding Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest, for nearly two weeks and say they have killed scores of fighters, including senior Hamas operatives. Gaza’s Health Ministry said more than 100 patients remain with no potable water and septic wounds, while doctors use plastic bags for gloves.
Not far from Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, dozens of members of Gaza’s tiny Palestinian Christian community gathered at the Holy Family Church to celebrate Easter, with incense wafting through the rare building that appeared untouched by war.
“We are here with sadness,” attendee Winnie Tarazi said. About 600 people shelter in the compound.
GAZA’S DEATH TOLL NEARS 33,000 AND HUNGER GROWS
The United Nations and partners warn that famine could occur in devastated, largely isolated northern Gaza. Humanitarian officials say deliveries by sea and air are not enough and that Israel must allow far more aid by road. Egypt has said thousands of trucks are waiting.
Israel says it places no limits on deliveries of humanitarian aid. It has blamed the U.N. and other international agencies for the failure to distribute more aid.
Gaza’s Health Ministry said Sunday that at least 32,782 Palestinians have been killed since the start of the war. The ministry’s count does not differentiate between civilians and fighters, but it has said that women and children make up around two-thirds of those killed.
Israel says over one-third of the dead are militants, though it has not provided evidence, and it blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the group operates in residential areas.
Amid concerns about a wider conflict in the region, Lebanese state media reported that an Israeli drone struck a car in the southern Lebanese town of Konin.
A Lebanese security official told The Associated Press that Hezbollah militant Ismail al-Zain was killed, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. Israel’s military called al-Zain a “significant commander.” Hezbollah confirmed the death.
Late Sunday, a Palestinian attacker stabbed three people in southern Israel, seriously wounding them, said the Hatzalah rescue service. Police said the attacker was shot, but gave no further details on his condition.

In a few short years, generative AI techniques have suddenly exploded into a revolutionary new type of creative tool.
Using mere text descriptions, it’s now possible to conjure creative works into existence, as if by magic. People have rightly been quick to compare this revolution to the invention of photography, the phonograph, synthesizers or the internet.
Like earlier creative technologies, AI is disrupting existing creative practices. But more than just competing with traditional creative methods, leading generative AI tools also exploit the creative labor and talent of previous creative work used to train them.
Thus, a fierce debate is underway about how rights relating to the material employed to train generative AI tools should be treated.
One camp, including the emerging AI giants OpenAI and StabilityAI, argues that it is ""fair use"" to scrape the world’s creative archive to train generative AI models. Are these AI models not, after all, just like people, learning about art and aesthetics from history and the world around them?
Others with a stake in the issue tend to be artists and other copyright holders. Even if they might appreciate this view philosophically (and many do not), they still understand their existing intellectual property rights to include the right to refuse the use of their creative work as AI training data. In their view, companies need their permission.
At heart, this division is confounded by the nature of generative AI: generated outputs do not directly reference training data inputs, but digest and regurgitate them. There is no given means of attributing individual sources.
Even for creative industries accustomed to disruption, the situation is a genuine crisis – in part because it unsettles an established socioeconomic consensus, albeit one that is far from perfect.
Creative attribution is itself a social construct. The existing means we have at our disposal to discern and honor the value of individual creative works are the products of collisions and compromise between technology, law and creative practice.
Musical artists know that the economics of a single track break down into distinct intellectual property components, beginning with songwriting. Long before the advent of audio recording, a song, encoded on paper as sheet music, enjoyed copyright protection. Well over a century later, performances and audio recordings are now, in turn, robust copyrightable entities.
For example, if you were to listen on Spotify to Sinead O’Connor’s version of Nothing Compares 2 U, a song written by Prince, then 15 percent of some fraction of a cent goes in the direction of Prince’s estate or representatives for the songwriting part, the rest in the direction of O’Connor’s estate, or her label, performers, and so on, for the rendering of that song as recorded sound.
This 15 percent of a track’s value lying in the ‘song’ is a social construct, the outcome of negotiations between recording companies, publishers, streaming services and artists.
When generative AI creates outputs, there is no clear line of attribution back to specific training sources. The alternative is to pay a fixed fee for the data.
AI machine learning works by using enormous amounts of training data. If an AI company were to pay a fixed fee for the use of that data, then any individual artist’s remuneration would be a miniscule slice of a very big pie.
Would you accept a fraction of $1 for your music composition or oil painting to be used in a product that might then churn out endless imitations of your creative style without credit?
This is why many have now turned their attention to solving the problem of solving AI attribution, analyzing datasets or generative networks to discern the relative weights of influence of traditional IP concepts such as songwriting, recording and performing – just as techniques of AI generation lay claim to being able to discern and extract 'style’ and ‘content’ from creative materials.
So imagine someone used AI to generate a piece of guitar music, and the resulting piece of music sounded a little like Eddie Van Halen (whether intended or not). Putting a figure on that association, say it scored 10 percent in its ‘Van-Halen-ness’, with the remainder going to 10,000 other potential micro-influences (a bit of Beatles, a smidge of John Lee Hooker).
It is entirely conceivable, technically, to do something like this. And with the huge focus currently on generative AI and the means of training that AI, there are a lot of people looking at it. As well as potential pathways for remuneration, AI generation that afforded attribution would offer the basic respect of recognition – about which not just professionals but also amateur artists care deeply.
If handled appropriately, such attribution techniques could provide new insights into our own individual and cultural understanding of creativity as a social phenomenon – but only if those measures and techniques can be properly unpacked and debated.
At worst, artists would be forced to simply accept a dominant attribution engine, much as we accept the automated decisions of recommender engines – the algorithm-driven mystery machines that ‘suggest’ what we want to watch and listen to on any number of digital platforms. There’s a danger that the forward momentum behind generative AI, combined with this expectation of achievable attribution, forces an ill-considered and inequitable outcome.
Such attribution of indirect influences opens a very serious can of worms, where what is perceived as an influence, and measured as such by an opaque process, becomes taken as authoritative. In any such process, the emphasis should be the idea that the musical and artistic styles of the world are more a part of our cultural commons than anyone’s private possessions.   
And while artists may simply want to opt out of AI and ignore it, there’s a plausible scenario in which ‘big AI’ becomes a fragmented world where the only cultural data used is what has already been accumulated by large corporations, presenting new issues of access and inclusion.
It is impossible to tell whether automated attribution will become a significant part of our future. But it is essential that where it is used, it should not only be challenged itself through informed open debate, but also have the potential to drive forward concepts of copyright for the public good.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy dismissed a longtime aide and several advisers on Saturday in a continuing reshuffle while Russia unleashed fresh attacks overnight.
Zelenskyy dismissed top aide Serhiy Shefir from his post of first assistant, where he had served since 2019. The Ukrainian president also let go three advisers, and two presidential representatives overseeing volunteer activities and soldiers’ rights.
No explanation was given immediately for the latest changes in a wide-reaching personnel shakeup over recent months. It included the dismissal on Tuesday of Oleksii Danilov, who served as secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, and Valerii Zaluzhnyi as head of the armed forces on Feb. 8. Zaluzhnyi was appointed Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Kingdom earlier this month.
Ukraine’s air force said Saturday that Russia launched 12 Shahed drones overnight, nine of which were shot down, and fired four missiles into eastern Ukraine.
Russia unleashed a barrage of 38 missiles, 75 airstrikes and 98 attacks from multiple rocket launchers over the last 24 hours, Ukraine’s armed forces said in social media posts.
Two people were killed and one wounded in Russian shelling in Ukraine’s partially occupied Donetsk province, regional Gov. Vadym Filashkin said Saturday.
Ukrainian energy company Centrenergo announced Saturday that the Zmiiv Thermal Power Plant, one of the largest thermal power plants in the eastern Kharkiv region, was completely destroyed following Russian shelling last week. Power outage schedules were still in place for around 120,000 people in the region, where 700,000 people had lost electricity after the plant was hit on March 22.
Russia has escalated its attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in recent days, causing significant damage in several regions.
Officials in the Poltava region said Saturday there had been “several hits” to an infrastructure facility, without specifying whether it was an energy facility.
Meanwhile, the toll of Friday’s mass barrage of 99 drones and missiles hitting regions across Ukraine came to light on Saturday, with local officials in the Kherson region on Saturday morning announcing the death of one civilian. A resident of the Dnipropetrovsk region died in a hospital from shell wounds, according to regional Gov. Serhiy Lisak.

When the fifth and final installment of the Indiana Jones movie, Dial of Destiny, was released in 2023, it sparked a humorous exchange between generations.
A millennial expressed interest in seeing the latest installment but was met by a father's bemused response: ""Which Indiana Jones movie are you going to watch?"", emphasizing the film franchise's long history.
This bewilderment was warranted. In the opening scenes of the 2023 movie, audiences meet a noticeably younger version of Harrison Ford, reminiscent of his appearance in the 1980s films.
This de-aging effect was made possible by visual effects company, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM).
The creators claimed they didn't rely solely on Artificial Intelligence (AI) or machine learning but instead used a comprehensive VFX tool called ""ILM FaceSwap"" alongside the expertise of more than 100 visual effects artists, yet questions remain about the growing use of AI in filmmaking.
It's possible that the latest advances in AI technology could mean those visual effects artists may be redundant in the not-too distant future.
ChatGPT creator OpenAI has unveiled the first short films created using its new video AI tool Sora, with filmmakers describing the creations as “totally surreal”.
Early clips generated using the AI software show how it could take a simple written prompt and turn it into a realistic video of the scenario.
AI technology is remarkable. But there are concerns about its benefits and ethical implications, and how it can sometimes raise eyebrows.
AI is both a collaborator pushing the boundaries of artistic expression and sometimes seen as a potential threat to artists. The use of AI in film and television has been a contentious topic since last year's Hollywood strikes, where writers and actors expressed anxieties about their future in the industry.
AI has the potential to revolutionize filmmaking by creating scripts and generating visuals. However, challenges include audience acceptance, legal uncertainties surrounding copyright, and the ethical implications of AI dominance in creative industries will still plague its use. We might even see deceased movie legends gracing the silver screens soon enough.
Despite advancements, AI has its limitations. Unlike AI, artists can draw on real-life experiences and challenge people to see complexities, identifying and confronting biases within arts and other media forms.
The ethical and philosophical challenges of AI extend beyond aesthetics. The recent controversy surrounding the British royal family's poorly edited photo and questions about the authenticity of Princess of Wales, Kate Middleton's cancer announcement video highlights these concerns.
The creation of sexualized deepfakes without consent, often targeting women and leaving them with lasting trauma, poses significant ethical and legal challenges, prompting a re-evaluation of existing laws and responses.
AI's influence across these creative industries necessitates ongoing discussions to ensure responsible development and a future where human creativity and technological innovation can work cohesively.

When a total solar eclipse transforms day into night, will tortoises start acting romantic? Will giraffes gallop? Will apes sing odd notes?
Researchers will be standing by to observe how animals’ routines at the Fort Worth Zoo in Texas are disrupted when skies dim on April 8. They previously detected other strange animal behaviors in 2017 at a South Carolina zoo that was in the path of total darkness.
“To our astonishment, most of the animals did surprising things,” said Adam Hartstone-Rose, a North Carolina State University researcher who led the observations published in the journal Animals.
While there are many individual sightings of critters behaving bizarrely during historic eclipses, only in recent years have scientists started to rigorously study the altered behaviors of wild, domestic and zoo animals.
Seven years ago, Galapagos tortoises at the Riverbanks Zoo in Columbia, South Carolina, “that generally do absolutely nothing all day … during the peak of the eclipse, they all started breeding,” said Hartstone-Rose. The cause of the behavior is still unclear.
A mated pair of Siamangs, gibbons that usually call to each other in the morning, sang unusual tunes during the afternoon eclipse. A few male giraffes began to gallop in “apparent anxiety.” The flamingos huddled around their juveniles.
Researchers say that many animals display behaviors connected with an early dusk. Researchers will be standing by to observe how animals’ routines at the zoo are disrupted when skies dim on April 8.  Researchers previously detected strange animal behaviors in 2017 at a South Carolina zoo that was in the path of total darkness. During the last total solar eclipse in 2017, flamingos at a South Carolina zoo huddled protectively around their juveniles.
In April, Hartstone-Rose’s team plans to study similar species in Texas to see if the behaviors they witnessed before in South Carolina point to larger patterns.
Several other zoos along the path are also inviting visitors to help track animals, including zoos in Little Rock, Arkansas; Toledo, Ohio; and Indianapolis.
This year’s full solar eclipse in North America crisscrosses a different route than in 2017 and occurs in a different season, giving researchers and citizen scientists opportunities to observe new habits.
“It’s really high stakes. We have a really short period to observe them and we can’t repeat the experiment,” said Jennifer Tsuruda, a University of Tennessee entomologist who observed honeybee colonies during the 2017 eclipse.
The honeybees that Tsuruda studied decreased foraging during the eclipse, as they usually would at night, except for those from the hungriest hives.
“During a solar eclipse, there’s a conflict between their internal rhythms and external environment,” said University of Alberta’s Olav Rueppell, adding that bees rely on polarized light from the sun to navigate.
Nate Bickford, an animal researcher at Oregon Institute of Technology, said that “solar eclipses actually mimic short, fast-moving storms,” when skies darken and many animals take shelter.
After the 2017 eclipse, he analyzed data from tracking devices previously placed on wild species to study habitat use. Flying bald eagles change the speed and direction they’re moving during an eclipse, he said. So do feral horses, “probably taking cover, responding to the possibility of a storm out on the open plains.”
The last full U.S. solar eclipse to span coast to coast happened in late summer, in August. The upcoming eclipse in April gives researchers an opportunity to ask new questions including about potential impacts on spring migration.
Most songbird species migrate at night. “When there are night-like conditions during the eclipse, will birds think it’s time to migrate and take flight?” said Andrew Farnsworth of Cornell University.
His team plans to test this by analyzing weather radar data – which also detects the presence of flying birds, bats and insects – to see if more birds take wing during the eclipse.
As for indoor pets, they may react as much to what their owners are doing – whether they’re excited or nonchalant about the eclipse – as to any changes in the sky, said University of Arkansas animal researcher Raffaela Lesch.
“Dogs and cats pay a lot of attention to us, in addition to their internal clocks,” she said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin scoffed at the possibility of his country launching an attack on a NATO member, calling it “sheer nonsense,” but warned that any Western air base hosting U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets that are slated for deployment in Ukraine would be a “legitimate target” for the Kremlin’s forces.
“Their statements about our alleged intention to attack Europe after Ukraine is sheer nonsense,” Putin said late Wednesday, referring to warnings in the U.S. and Western Europe that Russia could turn its sights on other countries unless it’s stopped.
He noted that the U.S. defense budget is more than 10 times higher than Russia’s.
“In view of that, are we going to wage a war against NATO? It’s ravings,” he told military pilots during a visit to an air base.
Ukraine is awaiting the delivery of F-16s, which will increase military pressure on Russia, from its Western partners. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said last year that 42 F-16s had been promised. Ukrainian pilots have been training in the West for months on how to fly the warplanes.
The F-16s require a high standard of runways and reinforced hangars to protect them from bombing attacks when they are on the ground. It’s not clear how many Ukrainian air bases can meet those requirements, and Russia would be certain to quickly target a few that could accommodate them once the jets arrive.
Putin warned Ukraine’s Western allies against providing air bases in their countries from where the F-16s could launch sorties against the Kremlin’s forces. Those bases would become a “legitimate target,” he said.
“F-16s are capable of carrying nuclear weapons, and we will also need to take that into account while organizing our combat operations,” Putin added.
Military analysts have said the arrival of F-16s won’t be a game-changer in view of Russia’s massive air force and sophisticated air defense systems, though Ukrainian officials have welcomed them as an opportunity to hit back at Russia’s air dominance.
Putin insisted the F-16s “won’t change the situation on the battlefield.”
“We will destroy their warplanes just as we destroy their tanks, armored vehicles and other equipment, including multiple rocket launchers,” he said.
F-16s can be used to bolster Ukraine’s capability to target Russian facilities with long-range missile strikes. Ukraine’s counteroffensive last year came up short in part because it took place without air cover, placing its troops at the mercy of Russian aviation and artillery.
Russia has maintained air dominance in the war with Ukraine, though the provision of sophisticated Western air defense systems has forced Russian warplanes to avoid Ukrainian skies and launch attacks while remaining over Russia-controlled territory.
On Thursday, a Russian fighter jet crashed into the Black Sea off the Russia-occupied Crimean Peninsula, Sevastopol Gov. Mikhail Razvozhayev said. The pilot ejected and was recovered by rescue teams about 200 meters from shore, he said. Razvozhayev provided no details about the possible cause of the crash.
The Kremlin currently has a battlefield edge in weapons and troops, yielding recent incremental gains at points on the around 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, as Kyiv awaits more promised Western military support and mulls a broader mobilization.
Russia fired salvos of drones and missiles overnight at southern and eastern regions of Ukraine, authorities said Thursday, wounding more than a dozen people as the Kremlin’s forces persevered with attritional attacks designed to wear down Ukrainian defenses.
Air defense systems intercepted 26 out of 28 Shahed drones, Ukraine’s air force said. Russian forces also launched five missiles overnight, it said.
The regular bombardment of Ukraine by the Kremlin’s forces during the war has recently gained momentum, with missile barrages of the capital, Kyiv, and strikes on energy facilities across the country. The attacks also aim to weaken Ukrainian morale and act as retribution for Ukrainian long-range strikes on Russian soil.
One of Russia’s goals is to “deplete Ukraine’s inventory of ground-based air defense,” according to a recent military assessment published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
That would erode some of Ukraine’s combat ability as it waits on pledged but delayed military support from the West, including ammunition for its artillery and air defenses.
“Kyiv is confronted by the threat that an attritional war in the air domain will increasingly favor Russia without adequate support from the U.S. and its allies,” the IISS said. “Ukraine’s ability to continue to counter Russian air threats and impose costs on the Russian Aerospace Forces remains important to the outcome of the war.”
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Defense Minister Rustan Umerov both pleaded with foreign allies on Thursday to send more air defense systems and missiles.
The Ukrainian Mission to NATO said that it convened an extraordinary ambassador-level meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council at the alliance’s headquarters on Thursday in response to Russia’s missile attacks on critical infrastructure.
“Ukraine urgently requires more air defense and interceptors,” especially Patriot systems that can intercept ballistic missiles, Kuleba said in a video posted on X, formerly Twitter. Ukraine is the only country in the world targeted by ballistic missiles almost daily, he said.
Authorities in the Mykolaiv region, near the Black Sea in southern Ukraine, said that 12 people were wounded and six residential buildings were damaged in a Russian strike with a ballistic missile on the city on Wednesday afternoon.
In an overnight attack on the southern Ukraine region of Zaporizhzhia, Shahed drones struck a residential area, injuring two women ages 72 and 74, according to regional Gov. Ivan Fedorov. Rescue services said that seven buildings were damaged.
The Black Sea city of Odesa repelled three missile and drone attacks, officials said.
